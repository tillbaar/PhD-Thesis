abstract = {A unique form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in which clinical symptoms appear in the summer and subside spontaneously in the mid-autumn was found in Japan. This disease was named summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and was found the most prevalent form in Japan. This disease has the following characteristic features: 1) initiation in the summer; 2) repeated episodes during subsequent seasons for many years; 3) familial occurrence; 4) no occupational relationship; 5) positive returning-home provocation test; 6) cough, dyspnea and remittent fever as a clinical triad; 7) diffuse nodular shadows on chest x-ray film; 8) leukocytosis with neutrophilia; 9) moderately decreased \% VC and markedly decreased Dco and PaO2; 10) skin reactivity to PPD is negative while symptomatic; 11) pulmonary lesions of biopsied specimens show epithelioid cell granulomas without central necrosis (63.3 percent), plus alveolitis and/or pneumonitis; 12) isolation of patients from their home environment diminishes symptoms; 13) corticosteroid is effective; 14) seasonal atmospheric microbiological pollution is speculated upon, but the offending antigen is not defined yet.},

abstract = {The expression of specific mRNA isoforms may uniquely reflect the biological state of a cell because it reflects the integrated outcome of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. In this study, we constructed a splicing array to examine approximately 1,500 mRNA isoforms from a panel of genes previously implicated in prostate cancer and identified a large number of cell type-specific mRNA isoforms. We also developed a novel "two-dimensional" profiling strategy to simultaneously quantify changes in splicing and transcript abundance; the results revealed extensive covariation between transcription and splicing in prostate cancer cells. Taking advantage of the ability of our technology to analyze RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, we derived a specific set of mRNA isoform biomarkers for prostate cancer using independent panels of tissue samples for feature selection and cross-analysis. A number of cancer-specific splicing switch events were further validated by laser capture microdissection. Quantitative changes in transcription/RNA stability and qualitative differences in splicing ratio may thus be combined to characterize tumorigenic programs and signature mRNA isoforms may serve as unique biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and prognosis.},

In ancestral short-germ insects, an inner membrane, the amnion, covers the embryo ventrally, and an outer membrane, the serosa, completely surrounds the embryo. An early differentiation step partitions the uniform blastoderm into the anterior-dorsal serosa and the posterior-ventral germ rudiment giving rise to amnion and embryo proper. In Drosophila, amnioserosa formation depends on the dorsoventral patterning gene zerkn\"{u}llt (zen), a derived Hox3 gene.},

These high-throughput sequencing technologies make deep transcriptome sequencing and transcript quantification, whole genome sequencing and resequencing available to many more researchers and projects. However, while the cost and time have been greatly reduced, the error profiles and limitations of the new platforms differ significantly from those of previous sequencing technologies. The selection of an appropriate sequencing platform for particular types of experiments is an important consideration, and requires a detailed understanding of the technologies available; including sources of error, error rate, as well as the speed and cost of sequencing. We review the relevant concepts and compare the issues raised by the current high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. We analyze how future developments may overcome these limitations and what challenges remain.},

@article{Shen2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiplex PCR, defined as the simultaneous amplification of multiple regions of a DNA template or multiple DNA templates using more than one primer set (comprising a forward primer and a reverse primer) in one tube, has been widely used in diagnostic applications of clinical and environmental microbiology studies. However, primer design for multiplex PCR is still a challenging problem and several factors need to be considered. These problems include mis-priming due to nonspecific binding to non-target DNA templates, primer dimerization, and the inability to separate and purify DNA amplicons with similar electrophoretic mobility.

RESULTS: A program named MPprimer was developed to help users for reliable multiplex PCR primer design. It employs the widely used primer design program Primer3 and the primer specificity evaluation program MFEprimer to design and evaluate the candidate primers based on genomic or transcript DNA database, followed by careful examination to avoid primer dimerization. The graph-expanding algorithm derived from the greedy algorithm was used to determine the optimal primer set combinations (PSCs) for multiplex PCR assay. In addition, MPprimer provides a virtual electrophotogram to help users choose the best PSC. The experimental validation from 2x to 5x plex PCR demonstrates the reliability of MPprimer. As another example, MPprimer is able to design the multiplex PCR primers for DMD (dystrophin gene which caused Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), which has 79 exons, for 20x, 20x, 20x, 14x, and 5x plex PCR reactions in five tubes to detect underlying exon deletions.

CONCLUSIONS: MPprimer is a valuable tool for designing specific, non-dimerizing primer set combinations with constrained amplicons size for multiplex PCR assays.},

@article{Skaloud2011,
abstract = {Micrasterias, the name of which is derived from the Greek for 'little star', comprises possibly the most spectacularly shaped desmids (Desmidiales, Streptophyta). Presently, the genus Micrasterias includes about 60 traditional species, the majority of which were described in the early 19th century. We used a comprehensive multigene dataset (including SSU rDNA, psaA, and coxIII loci) of 34 Micrasterias taxa to assess the relationships between individual morphological species. The resulting phylogeny was used to assess the patterns characterizing the morphological evolution of this genus. The phylogenetic analysis led to the recognition of eight well-resolved lineages that could be characterized by selected morphological features. Apart from the members of Micrasterias, three species belonged to different traditional desmid genera (Cosmarium, Staurodesmus, and Triploceras) and were inferred to be nested within the genus. Morphological comparisons of these species with their relatives revealed an accelerated rate of morphological evolution. Mapping morphological diversification of the genus on the phylogenetic tree revealed profound differences in the phylogenetic signal of selected phenotypic features. Whereas the branching pattern of the cells clearly correlated with the phylogeny, cell complexity possibly reflected rather their adaptive morphological responses to environmental conditions. Finally, ancestral reconstruction of distribution patterns indicated potential origin of the genus in North America, with additional speciation events occurring in the Indo-Malaysian region.},

abstract = {We studied the role of Wnt signaling in axis formation during metamorphosis and regeneration in the cnidarian Hydractinia. Activation of Wnt downstream events during metamorphosis resulted in a complete oralization of the animals and repression of aboral structures (i.e. stolons). The expression of Wnt3, Tcf and Brachyury was upregulated and became ubiquitous. Rescue experiments using Tcf RNAi resulted in normal metamorphosis and quantitatively normal Wnt3 and Brachyury expression. Isolated, decapitated polyps regenerated only heads but no stolons. Activation of Wnt downstream targets in regenerating animals resulted in oralization of the polyps. Knocking down Tcf or Wnt3 by RNAi inhibited head regeneration and resulted in complex phenotypes that included ectopic aboral structures. Multiple heads then grew when the RNAi effect had dissipated. Our results provide functional evidence that Wnt promotes head formation but represses the formation of stolons, whereas downregulation of Wnt promotes stolons and represses head formation.},

@article{Anderberg2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) also named aquaporins form channels facilitating the passive transport of water and other small polar molecules across membranes. MIPs are particularly abundant and diverse in terrestrial plants but little is known about their evolutionary history. In an attempt to investigate the origin of the plant MIP subfamilies, genomes of chlorophyte algae, the sister group of charophyte algae and land plants, were searched for MIP encoding genes.

RESULTS: A total of 22 MIPs were identified in the nine analysed genomes and phylogenetic analyses classified them into seven subfamilies. Two of these, Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) and GlpF-like Intrinsic Proteins (GIPs), are also present in land plants and divergence dating support a common origin of these algal and land plant MIPs, predating the evolution of terrestrial plants. The subfamilies unique to algae were named MIPA to MIPE to facilitate the use of a common nomenclature for plant MIPs reflecting phylogenetically stable groups. All of the investigated genomes contained at least one MIP gene but only a few species encoded MIPs belonging to more than one subfamily.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that at least two of the seven subfamilies found in land plants were present already in an algal ancestor. The total variation of MIPs and the number of different subfamilies in chlorophyte algae is likely to be even higher than that found in land plants. Our analyses indicate that genetic exchanges between several of the algal subfamilies have occurred. The PIP1 and PIP2 groups and the Ca2+ gating appear to be specific to land plants whereas the pH gating is a more ancient characteristic shared by all PIPs. Further studies are needed to discern the function of the algal specific subfamilies MIPA-E and to fully understand the evolutionary relationship of algal and terrestrial plant MIPs.},

abstract = {One of the major steps in the evolution of life was the origin of photosynthesis in nucleated cells underpinning the evolution of plants. It is well accepted that this evolutionary process was initiated when a photosynthetic bacterium (a cyanobacterium) was taken up by a colorless host cell, probably more than a billion years ago, and transformed into a photosynthetic organelle (a plastid) during a process known as primary endosymbiosis. Here, we use sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of the prokaryotic rDNA operon to show that the thecate, filose amoeba Paulinella chromatophora Lauterborn obtained its photosynthetic organelles by a similar but more recent process, which involved a different cyanobacterium, indicating that the evolution of photosynthetic organelles from cyanobacteria was not a unique event, as is commonly believed, but may be an ongoing process.},

abstract = {An important missing piece in the puzzle of how plastids spread across the eukaryotic tree of life is a robust evolutionary framework for the host lineages. Four assemblages are known to harbour plastids derived from red algae and, according to the controversial chromalveolate hypothesis, these all share a common ancestry. Phylogenomic analyses have consistently shown that stramenopiles and alveolates are closely related, but haptophytes and cryptophytes remain contentious; they have been proposed to branch together with several heterotrophic groups in the newly erected Hacrobia. Here, we tested this question by producing a large expressed sequence tag dataset for the katablepharid Roombia truncata, one of the last hacrobian lineages for which genome-level data are unavailable, and combined this dataset with the recently completed genome of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta to build an alignment composed of 258 genes. Our analyses strongly support haptophytes as sister to the SAR group, possibly together with telonemids and centrohelids. We also confirmed the common origin of katablepharids and cryptophytes, but these lineages were not related to other hacrobians; instead, they branch with plants.

MFEprimer can help the user to select more suitable primers before running either standard or multiplex PCR reactions. The cDNA and genomic DNA databases of 10 widely used species, as well as user custom databases, were used as DNA templates for analyzing primers specificity. Furthermore, we maintained a Primer3Plus server with a modified Primer3Manager for one-stop primer design and specificity checking.},

abstract = {The cost analysis of a real facility for the production of high value microalgae biomass is presented. The facility is based on ten 3 m3 tubular photobioreactors operated in continuous mode for 2 years, data of Scenedesmus almeriensis productivity but also of nutrients and power consumption from this facility being used. The yield of the facility was close to maximum expected for the location of Almer\'{\i}a, the annual production capacity being 3.8 t/year (90 t/ha·year) and the photosynthetic efficiency being 3.6\%. The production cost was 69 €/kg. Economic analysis shows that labor and depreciation are the major factors contributing to this cost. Simplification of the technology and scale-up to a production capacity of 200 t/year allows to reduce the production cost up to 12.6 €/kg. Moreover, to reduce the microalgae production cost to approaches the energy or commodities markets it is necessary to reduce the photobioreactor cost (by simplifying its design or materials used), use waste water and flue gases, and reduce the power consumption and labor required for the production step. It can be concluded that although it has been reported that production of biofuels from microalgae is relatively close to being economically feasible, data here reported demonstrated that to achieve it by using the current production technologies, it is necessary to substantially reduce their costs and to operate them near their optimum values.},

abstract = {Herpesviruses comprise an abundant, widely distributed group of large DNA viruses of humans and other vertebrates, and overall are among the most extensively studied large DNA viruses. Many herpesvirus genome sequences have been determined, and interpreted in terms of gene contents to give detailed views of both ubiquitous and lineage-specific functions. Availability of gene sequences has also enabled evaluations of evolutionary relationships. For herpesviruses of mammals, a robust phylogenetic tree has been constructed, which shows many features characteristic of synchronous development of virus and host lineages over large evolutionary timespans. It has also emerged that three distinct groupings of herpesviruses exist: the first containing viruses with mammals, birds and reptiles as natural hosts; the second containing viruses of amphibians and fish; and the third consisting of a single invertebrate herpesvirus. Within each of the first two groups, the genomes show clear evidence of descent from a common ancestor, but relationships between the three groups are extremely remote. Detailed analyses of capsid structures provide the best evidence for a common origin of the three groups. At a finer level, the structure of the capsid shell protein further suggests an element of common origin between herpesviruses and tailed DNA bacteriophages.},

abstract = {We describe a semi-empirical framework that combines thermodynamic models of primer hybridization with experimentally determined elongation biases introduced by 3'-end mismatches for improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based sequence discrimination. The framework enables rational and automatic design of primers for optimal targeting of one or more sequences in ensembles of nearly identical DNA templates. In situations where optimal targeting is not feasible, the framework accurately predicts non-target sequences that are difficult to distinguish with PCR alone. Based on the synergistic effects of disparate sources of PCR bias, we used our framework to robustly distinguish between two alleles that differ by a single base pair. To demonstrate the applicability to environmental microbiology, we designed primers specific to all recognized archaeal and bacterial genera in the Ribosomal Database Project, and have made these primers available online. We applied these primers experimentally to obtain genus-specific amplification of 16S rRNA genes representing minor constituents of an environmental DNA sample. Our results demonstrate that inherent PCR biases can be reliably employed in an automatic fashion to maximize sequence discrimination and accurately identify potential cross-amplifications. We have made our framework accessible online as a programme for designing primers targeting one group of sequences in a set with many other sequences (http://DECIPHER.cee.wisc.edu).},

abstract = {Fatty acids represent an important energy source for preimplantation embryos. Fatty acids oxidation is correlated with the embryo oxygen consumption which remains relatively constant up to the 8-cell stage, but suddenly increases between the 8-cell and morula stages. The degradation of fatty acids occurs in mitochondria and is catalyzed by several carnitine acyl transferases, including two carnitine palmitoyl transferases, CPT-I and CPT-II. We have carried out a study to determine the relative number of transcripts of Cpt1b and Cpt2 genes encoding for m-CPT-I and CPT-II enzymes, during mouse preimplantation development. Here we show that Cpt1b transcripts are first and temporally detected at the 2-cell stage and reappear at the morula and blastocyst stage. Cpt2 transcripts decrease following fertilization to undetectable levels and are present again later at the morula stage. These results show that transcription of both Cpt1b and Cpt2 is triggered at the morula stage, concomitantly with known increasing profiles of oxygen uptake and fatty acids oxidation. Based on the number of Cpt2 transcripts detected, we could discriminate the presence of two groups of embryos with high and low number of transcripts, from the zygote throughout preimplantation development. To further investigate if the establishment of these two groups of embryos occurs prior to fertilization, we have analyzed the relative number of transcripts of both genes in antral and ovulated MII oocytes. As for preimplantation embryos, MII oocytes show two groups of Cpt2 expression. Antral oocytes, classified according to their chromatin configuration in SN (surrounded nucleolus, in which the nucleolus is surrounded by a rim of Hoechst-positive chromatin) and NSN (not surrounded nucleolus, in which this rim is absent), show three groups with different numbers of Cpt2 transcripts. All NSN oocytes have a number of Cpt2 transcripts doubled compared to that of the group of MII oocytes with high expression. Instead, SN oocytes could be singled out into two groups with high and low numbers of Cpt2 transcripts, similar to those found in MII oocytes. The results of this study point out a correlation between the timing of fatty acids oxidation during preimplantation development and the expression of two genes encoding two enzymes involved in the oxidative pathway. Furthermore, although the biological meaning for the presence of two groups of oocytes/embryos with different levels of Cpt2 transcripts remains unclear, the data obtained suggest a possible correlation between the levels of Cpt2 expression and embryo developmental competence.},

abstract = {Nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA sequences have been obtained from 64 strains of conjugating green algae (Zygnemophyceae, Streptophyta, Viridiplantae). Molecular phylogenetic analyses of 90 SSU rDNA sequences of Viridiplantae (inciuding 78 from the Zygnemophyceae) were performed using complex evolutionary models and maximum likelihood, distance, and maximum parsimony methods. The significance of the results was tested by bootstrap analyses, deletion of long-branch taxa, relative rate tests, and Kishino-Hasegawa tests with user-defined trees. All results support the monophyly of the class Zygnemophyceae and of the order Desmidiales. The second order, Zygnematales, forms a series of early-branching clades in paraphyletic succession, with the two traditional families Mesotaeniaceae and Zygnemataceae not recovered as lineages. Instead, a long-branch Spirogyra/Sirogonium clade and the later-diverging Netrium and Roya clades represent independent clades. Within the order Desmidiales, the families Gonatozygaceae and Closteriaceae are monophyletic, whereas the Peniaceae (represented only by Penium margaritaceum) and the Desmidiaceae represent a single weakly supported lineage. Within the Desmidiaceae short internal branches and varying rates of sequence evolution among taxa reduce the phylogenetic resolution significantly. The SSU rDNA-based phylogeny is largely congruent with a published analysis of the rbcL phylogeny of the Zygnemophyceae (McCourt et al. 2000) and is also in general agreement with classification schemes based on cell wall ultrastructure. The extended taxon sampling at the subgenus level provides solid evidence that many genera in the Zygnemophyceae are not monophyletic and that the genus concept in the group needs to be revised.},

abstract = {The SWISS-PROT protein sequence data bank contains at present nearly 75,000 entries, almost two thirds of which include the potential N-glycosylation consensus sequence, or sequon, NXS/T (where X can be any amino acid but proline) and thus may be glycoproteins. The number of proteins filed as glycoproteins is however considerably smaller, 7942, of which 749 have been characterized with respect to the total number of their carbohydrate units and sites of attachment of the latter to the protein, as well as the nature of the carbohydrate-peptide linking group. Of these well characterized glycoproteins, about 90\% carry either N-linked carbohydrate units alone or both N- and O-linked ones, attached at 1297 N-glycosylation sites (1.9 per glycoprotein molecule) and the rest are O-glycosylated only. Since the total number of sequons in the well characterized glycoproteins is 1968, their rate of occupancy is 2/3. Assuming that the same number of N-linked units and rate of sequon occupancy occur in all sequon containing proteins and that the proportion of solely O-glycosylated proteins (ca. 10\%) will also be the same as among the well characterized ones, we conclude that the majority of sequon containing proteins will be found to be glycosylated and that more than half of all proteins are glycoproteins.},

@article{Koumandou2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In membrane trafficking, the mechanisms ensuring vesicle fusion specificity remain to be fully elucidated. Early models proposed that specificity was encoded entirely by SNARE proteins; more recent models include contributions from Rab proteins, Syntaxin-binding (SM) proteins and tethering factors. Most information on membrane trafficking derives from an evolutionarily narrow sampling of model organisms. However, considering factors from a wider diversity of eukaryotes can provide both functional information on core systems and insight into the evolutionary history of the trafficking machinery. For example, the major Qa/syntaxin SNARE families are present in most eukaryotic genomes and likely each evolved via gene duplication from a single ancestral syntaxin before the existing eukaryotic groups diversified. This pattern is also likely for Rabs and various other components of the membrane trafficking machinery.

RESULTS: We performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, when relevant, on the SM proteins and components of the tethering complexes, both thought to contribute to vesicle fusion specificity. Despite evidence suggestive of secondary losses amongst many lineages, the tethering complexes are well represented across the eukaryotes, suggesting an origin predating the radiation of eukaryotic lineages. Further, whilst we detect distant sequence relations between GARP, COG, exocyst and DSL1 components, these similarities most likely reflect convergent evolution of similar secondary structural elements. No similarity is found between the TRAPP and HOPS complexes and the other tethering factors. Overall, our data favour independent origins for the various tethering complexes. The taxa examined possess at least one homologue of each of the four SM protein families; since the four monophyletic families each encompass a wide diversity of eukaryotes, the SM protein families very likely evolved before the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LCEA).

CONCLUSION: These data further support a highly complex LCEA and indicate that the basic architecture of the trafficking system is remarkably conserved and ancient, with the SM proteins and tethering factors having originated very early in eukaryotic evolution. However, the independent origin of the tethering complexes suggests a novel pattern for increasing complexity in the membrane trafficking system, in addition to the pattern of paralogous machinery elaboration seen thus far.},

Although chromophytes are known to be evolutionary chimaeras of a red alga and a non-photosynthetic host, which gave rise to their exceptional membrane complexity, their cell biology is poorly understood. Cryptomonads are the only chromophytes that still retain the enslaved red algal nucleus as a minute nucleomorph. Here we report complete sequences for all three nucleomorph chromosomes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. This tiny 551-kilobase eukaryotic genome is the most gene-dense known, with only 17 diminutive spliceosomal introns and 44 overlapping genes. Marked evolutionary compaction hundreds of millions of years ago eliminated nearly all the nucleomorph genes for metabolic functions, but left 30 for chloroplast-located proteins. To allow expression of these proteins, nucleomorphs retain hundreds of genetic-housekeeping genes. Nucleomorph DNA replication and periplastid protein synthesis require the import of many nuclear gene products across endoplasmic reticulum and periplastid membranes. The chromosomes have centromeres, but possibly only one loop domain, offering a means for studying eukaryotic chromosome replication, segregation and evolution.},

abstract = {With the astonishing rate that genomic and metagenomic sequence data sets are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene families have generally been referred to as "marker" genes. We are particularly interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities (e.g., construction of species trees, phylogenetic based assignment of metagenomic sequence reads to taxonomic groups, phylogeny-based assessment of alpha- and beta-diversity of microbial communities from metagenomic data). We therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology) markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for "all bacteria and archaea", 114 for "all bacteria (greatly expanding on the ∼30 commonly used), and 100 s to 1000 s for some of the individual phyla of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than possible previously.},

Rab11 and Rab8 coordinate their actions via Rabin8, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Rab8. A cascade of protein-protein interactions involving the Rabs and the exocyst complex couples the generation of secretory vesicles at donor compartments to their docking and fusion at the plasma membrane.

Electroporation of strains CC3395 and CC425, cell wall-less mutants devoid of argininosuccinate lyase (encoded by ARG7), in the presence of the plasmid pJD67 (which contains ARG7) was used to optimize conditions for the introduction of exogenous DNA. The conditions that were varied included osmolarity, temperature, concentration of exogenous DNA, voltage and capacitance. Following optimization, the maximum transformation frequency obtained was 2 x 10(5) transformants per microg of DNA; this frequency is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained with the current standard method using glass beads to introduce exogenous DNA. The electroporation procedure described in this article is of general utility, and makes it feasible to isolate genes by direct complementation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants.},

abstract = {As the initial barrier to viral entry, the plasma membrane along with the membrane trafficking machinery and cytoskeleton are of fundamental importance in the viral cycle. However, little is known about the contribution of plasma membrane dynamics during early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Considering that ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) regulates cellular invasion via several microorganisms by coordinating membrane trafficking, our aim was to study the function of Arf6-mediated membrane dynamics on HIV-1 entry and infection of T lymphocytes. We observed that an alteration of the Arf6-guanosine 5'-diphosphate/guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP/GDP) cycle, by GDP-bound or GTP-bound inactive mutants or by specific Arf6 silencing, inhibited HIV-1 envelope-induced membrane fusion, entry, and infection of T lymphocytes and permissive cells, regardless of viral tropism. Furthermore, cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission of primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes was inhibited by Arf6 knockdown. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that Arf6 mutants provoked the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-biphosphate-associated structures on the plasma membrane of permissive cells, without affecting CD4-viral attachment but impeding CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry. Arf6 silencing or its mutants did not affect fusion, entry, and infection of vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped viruses or ligand-induced CXCR4 or CCR5 endocytosis, both clathrin-dependent processes. Therefore we propose that efficient early HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T lymphocytes requires Arf6-coordinated plasma membrane dynamics that promote viral fusion and entry.},

abstract = {Channelrhodopsins act as photoreceptors for control of motility behavior in flagellates and are widely used as genetically targeted tools to optically manipulate the membrane potential of specific cell populations ("optogenetics"). The first two channelrhodopsins were obtained from the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrChR1 and CrChR2). By homology cloning we identified three new channelrhodopsin sequences from the same genus, CaChR1, CyChR1 and CraChR2, from C. augustae, C. yellowstonensis and C. raudensis, respectively. CaChR1 and CyChR1 were functionally expressed in HEK293 cells, where they acted as light-gated ion channels similar to CrChR1. However, both, which are similar to each other, differed from CrChR1 in current kinetics, inactivation, light intensity dependence, spectral sensitivity and dependence on the external pH. These results show that extensive channelrhodopsin diversity exists even within the same genus, Chlamydomonas. The maximal spectral sensitivity of CaChR1 was at 520 nm at pH 7.4, about 40 nm redshifted as compared to that of CrChR1 under the same conditions. CaChR1 was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and exhibited an absorption spectrum identical to the action spectrum of CaChR1-generated photocurrents. The redshifted spectra and the lack of fast inactivation in CaChR1- and CyChR1-generated currents are features desirable for optogenetics applications.},

abstract = {Salmonella typhimurium elicits an acute inflammatory response in the host intestinal epithelium, characterized by the movement of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) across the epithelial monolayer to the intestinal lumen. It was recently shown that SipA, a protein secreted by S. typhimurium, is necessary and sufficient to drive PMN transmigration across model intestinal epithelia (Lee, C. A., Silva, M., Siber, A. M., Kelly, A. J., Galyov, E., and McCormick, B. A. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97, 12283-12288). However, the epithelial factors responsible for this process have not been identified. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that S. typhimurium-induced PMN transmigration across Madin-Darby canine kidney-polarized monolayers is regulated by the GTPase ARF6. Apically added S. typhimurium promoted the translocation of ARF6 and its exchange factor ARNO to the apical surface. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF6 inhibited Salmonella-induced PMN transmigration, which was due to a reduction in apical release of the PMN chemoattractant PEEC (pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant), without affecting bacterial internalization. Furthermore, ARF6 and its effector phospholipase D (PLD) were both required for bacteria-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to membranes. These results describe a novel signal transduction pathway, in which Salmonella initiates an ARF6- and PLD-dependent lipid signaling cascade that, in turn, directs activation of PKC, release of PEEC, and subsequent transepithelial PMN movement.},

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

For example, recent work suggests that the long-sought-after target of the analgesic acetaminophen is a neural-specific, alternatively spliced isoform of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1). Several important diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, have been linked with mutations or variations in either cis-acting elements or trans-acting factors that lead to aberrant splicing and abnormal protein production. Correction of erroneous splicing is thus an important goal of molecular therapies. Recent experiments have used modified oligonucleotides to inhibit cryptic exons or to activate exons weakened by mutations, suggesting that these reagents could eventually lead to effective therapies.},

abstract = {A DNA barcode is a preferrably short and highly variable region of DNA supposed to facilitate a rapid identification of species. In many protistan lineages, a lack of species-specific morphological characters hampers an identification of species by light or electron microscopy, and difficulties to perform mating experiments in laboratory cultures also do not allow for an identification of biological species. Thus, testing candidate barcode markers as well as establishment of accurately working species identification systems are more challenging than in multicellular organisms. In cryptic species complexes the performance of a potential barcode marker can not be monitored using morphological characters as a feedback, but an inappropriate choice of DNA region may result in artifactual species trees for several reasons. Therefore a priori knowledge of the systematics of a group is required. In addition to identification of known species, methods for an automatic delimitation of species with DNA barcodes have been proposed. The Cryptophyceae provide a mixture of systematically well characterized as well as badly characterized groups and are used in this study to test the suitability of some of the methods for protists. As species identification method the performance of blast in searches against badly to well-sampled reference databases has been tested with COI-5P and 5'-partial LSU rDNA (domains A to D of the nuclear LSU rRNA gene). In addition the performance of two different methods for automatic species delimitation, fixed thresholds of genetic divergence and the general mixed Yule-coalescent model (GMYC), have been examined. The study demonstrates some pitfalls of barcoding methods that have to be taken care of. Also a best-practice approach towards establishing a DNA barcode system in protists is proposed.},

@article{Maul1993,
abstract = {The outcome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection depends upon the interplay of both host and viral factors. During lytic infection, HSV-1 causes a loss of immunofluorescent staining of discrete nuclear domains (ND10). This elimination of the host's ND10 staining occurs under conditions that allow only HSV-1 immediate early viral gene expression. Western blot analysis indicates that the loss of ND10 staining is due to ND10 redistribution, rather than protein degradation or turnover. When deletion mutants of all of the HSV-1 immediate early genes were tested, only infection with an immediate early gene 1 product (ICP0) deletion mutant, d11403, was unable to eliminate ND10 antigen staining. Also, ICP0 transiently colocalized with ND10 antigens, after which ND10 antigens became undetectable. At late times during infection with d11403, the host ND10 antigens were retained in virus-induced structures which were never observed during wild-type HSV-1 infection. These results suggested that ICP0 may be directly involved in the modification of the host nuclear domain. Infection with an adenovirus recombinant that expressed ICP0 demonstrated that in the absence of other HSV-1 proteins ICP0 was sufficient for the change in nuclear distribution of host antigens located at ND10. We postulate that the trans-activation function of ICP0 during viral replication may be mediated by replacing, modifying or reorganizing nuclear host factors.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

@article{Hawkey2008,
abstract = {Since the first usage of antimicrobials, the burden of resistance among bacteria has progressively increased and has accelerated within the last 10 years. Antibiotic resistance genes were present at very low levels prior to the introduction of antibiotics and it is largely the selective pressure of antibiotic use and the resulting exposure of bacteria, not only in humans but also in companion and food animals and the environment, which has caused the rise. The increasing mobility across the globe of people, food and animals is another factor. Examples of this are the international pandemic of different genotypes of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (particularly CTX-M-14 and -15) and the emergence of the carbapenemase KPC-1 in both the USA and Israel. This review details examples of both the emergence and dissemination through different genetic routes, both direct and indirect selective pressure, of significance resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas/Acinetobacter. The response made by society to reduce resistance involves surveillance, reduced usage, improved infection control and the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. Although efforts are being made in all these areas, there is an urgent need to increase the effectiveness of these interventions or some bacterial infections will become difficult if not impossible to treat reliably.},

@article{Lewis2004,
abstract = {Over the past two decades, molecular phylogenetic data have allowed evaluations of hypotheses on the evolution of green algae based on vegetative morphological and ultrastructural characters. Higher taxa are now generally recognized on the basis of ultrastructural characters. Molecular analyses have mostly employed primarily nuclear small subunit rDNA (18S) and plastid rbcL data, as well as data on intron gain, complete genome sequencing, and mitochondrial sequences. Molecular-based revisions of classification at nearly all levels have occurred, from dismemberment of long-established genera and families into multiple classes, to the circumscription of two major lineages within the green algae. One lineage, the chlorophyte algae or Chlorophyta sensu stricto, comprises most of what are commonly called green algae and includes most members of the grade of putatively ancestral scaly flagellates in Prasinophyceae plus members of Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Chlorophyceae. The other lineage (charophyte algae and embryophyte land plants), comprises at least five monophyletic groups of green algae, plus embryophytes. A recent multigene analysis corroborates a close relationship between Mesostigma (formerly in the Prasinophyceae) and the charophyte algae, although sequence data of the Mesostigma mitochondrial genome analysis places the genus as sister to charophyte and chlorophyte algae. These studies also support Charales as sister to land plants. The reorganization of taxa stimulated by molecular analyses is expected to continue as more data accumulate and new taxa and habitats are sampled.},

abstract = {Polarization of the C. elegans zygote is initiated by ECT-2-dependent cortical flows, which mobilize the anterior PAR proteins (PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3) away from the future posterior end of the embryo marked by the sperm centrosome. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel and redundant pathway that can polarize the zygote in the absence of ECT-2-dependent cortical flows. This second pathway depends on the polarity protein PAR-2. We show that PAR-2 localizes to the cortex nearest the sperm centrosome even in the absence of cortical flows. Once on the cortex, PAR-2 antagonizes PAR-3-dependent recruitment of myosin, creating myosin flows that transport the anterior PAR complex away from PAR-2 in a positive-feedback loop. We propose that polarity in the C. elegans zygote is initiated by redundant ECT-2- and PAR-2-dependent mechanisms that lower PAR-3 levels locally, triggering a positive-feedback loop that polarizes the entire cortex.},

However, challenges remain in understanding the source and distribution of the reads, modeling the transcript abundance and developing efficient computational methods. In this article, we develop a method to deal with the isoform expression estimation problem. The count of reads falling into a locus on the genome annotated with multiple isoforms is modeled as a Poisson variable. The expression of each individual isoform is estimated by solving a convex optimization problem and statistical inferences about the parameters are obtained from the posterior distribution by importance sampling. Our results show that isoform expression inference in RNA-Seq is possible by employing appropriate statistical methods.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of the taxonomically informative 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene provides a powerful approach for exploring microbial diversity. Here we compare the performance of two common "benchtop" sequencing platforms, Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM, for bacterial community profiling by 16S rRNA (V1-V2) amplicon sequencing. We benchmark performance using a 20-organism mock bacterial community and a collection of primary human specimens. We observed comparatively higher error rates from the Ion Torrent platform and report a pattern of premature sequence truncation specific to semiconductor sequencing. Read truncation was dependent both on directionality of sequencing and the target species, resulting in organism-specific biases in community profiles. We found that these sequencing artifacts could be minimized using bidirectional amplicon sequencing and an optimized flow order on the Ion Torrent platform. Bacterial community profiling performed on the mock community and a collection of 18 human-derived microbiological specimens were generally in good agreement for both platforms; however, in some cases results differed significantly. Disparities could be attributed to the failure to generate full-length reads for particular organisms on the Ion Torrent platform, organism-dependent differences in sequence error rates affecting classification of certain species, or some combination of these factors. This study demonstrates the potential for differential bias in bacterial community profiles resulting from the choice of sequencing platforms alone.},

abstract = {By using a method in which cell-wall-deficient Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells were agitated in the presence of DNA, glass beads, and polyethylene glycol, nuclear transformation rates of approximately 10(3) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA were achieved. The nitrate reductase gene from wild-type Chlamydomonas was used to complement a mutation in the corresponding gene of a strain containing nit1-305. Transformants were selected by growth with nitrate as sole source of nitrogen. The transforming DNA integrated into the genome at a low-copy number in nit+ transformants. When cells carrying nit1-305 were agitated in the presence of two plasmids, one with the gene for nitrate reductase and the second with an unselected gene, the unselected gene was present in 10-50\% of nit+ transformants. This high frequency of cotransformation will allow any cloned gene to be introduced into Chlamydomonas. Moreover, the overall efficiency of transformation should be high enough to permit isolation of genes from genomic libraries by complementation of stable nuclear mutants. The availability of efficient nuclear and chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas provides specific advantages for the study of chloroplast biogenesis, photosynthesis, and nuclear-chloroplast genome interactions.},

In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The Cactaceae are a major New World plant family and popular in horticulture. Still, taxonomic units and species limits have been difficult to define, and molecular phylogenetic studies so far have yielded largely unresolved trees, so relationships within Cactaceae remain insufficiently understood. This study focuses on the predominantly epiphytic tribe Rhipsalideae and evaluates the utility of a spectrum of plastid genomic regions. •

METHODS: We present a phylogenetic study including 52 of the 53 Rhipsalideae species and all the infraspecific taxa. Seven regions (trnK intron, matK, rbcL, rps3-rpl16, rpl16 intron, psbA-trnH, trnQ-rps16), ca. 5600 nucleotides (nt) were sequenced per sample. The regions used were evaluated for their phylogenetic performance and performance in DNA-based species recognition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined beforehand. •

KEY RESULTS: The Rhipsalideae are monophyletic and contain five clades that correspond to the genera Rhipsalis, Lepismium, Schlumbergera, Hatiora, and Rhipsalidopsis. The species-level tree was well resolved and supported; the rpl16 and trnK introns yielded the best phylogenetic signal. Although the psbA-trnH and trnQ-rps16 spacers were the most successful individual regions for OTU identification, their success rate did not significantly exceed 70\%. The highest OTU identification rate of 97\% was found using the combination of psbA-trnH, rps3-rpl16, trnK intron, and trnQ-rps16 as a minimum possible marker length (ca. 1660 nt). •

CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic performance of a marker is not determined by the level of sequence variability, and species discrimination power does not necessarily correlate with phylogenetic utility.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples.

RESULTS: During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67\%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.},

abstract = {Trafficking of protein and lipid cargo through the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is mediated by membrane-bound vesicles. Secretory vesicle targeting and fusion require a conserved multisubunit protein complex termed the exocyst, which has been implicated in specific tethering of vesicles to sites of polarized exocytosis. The exocyst is directly involved in regulating soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes and membrane fusion through interactions between the Sec6 subunit and the plasma membrane SNARE protein Sec9. Here we show another facet of Sec6 function-it directly binds Sec1, another SNARE regulator, but of the Sec1/Munc18 family. The Sec6-Sec1 interaction is exclusive of Sec6-Sec9 but compatible with Sec6-exocyst assembly. In contrast, the Sec6-exocyst interaction is incompatible with Sec6-Sec9. Therefore, upon vesicle arrival, Sec6 is proposed to release Sec9 in favor of Sec6-exocyst assembly and to simultaneously recruit Sec1 to sites of secretion for coordinated SNARE complex formation and membrane fusion.},

Multidrug resistance in bacteria may be generated by one of two mechanisms. First, these bacteria may accumulate multiple genes, each coding for resistance to a single drug, within a single cell. This accumulation occurs typically on resistance (R) plasmids. Second, multidrug resistance may also occur by the increased expression of genes that code for multidrug efflux pumps, extruding a wide range of drugs. This review discusses our current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in both types of resistance.},

abstract = {Trichosporon asahii is the most common cause of fatal disseminated trichosporonosis, frequently associated with indwelling medical devices. Despite the use of antifungal drugs to treat trichosporonosis, infection is often persistent and is associated with high mortality. This drove our interest in evaluating the capability of T. asahii to form a biofilm on biomaterial-representative polystyrene surfaces through the development and optimization of a reproducible T. asahii-associated biofilm model. Time course analyses of viable counts and a formazan salt reduction assay, as well as microscopy studies, revealed that biofilm formation by T. asahii occurred in an organized fashion through four distinct developmental phases: initial adherence of yeast cells (0 to 2 h), germination and microcolony formation (2 to 4 h), filamentation (4 to 6 h), and proliferation and maturation (24 to 72 h). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that mature T. asahii biofilms (72-h) displayed a complex, heterogeneous three-dimensional structure, consisting of a dense network of metabolically active yeast cells and hyphal elements completely embedded within exopolymeric material. Antifungal susceptibility testing demonstrated a remarkable rise in the MICs of sessile T. asahii cells against clinically used amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole, and fluconazole compared to their planktonic counterparts. In particular, T. asahii biofilms were up to 16,000 times more resistant to voriconazole, the most active agent against planktonic cells (MIC, 0.06 microg/ml). Our results suggest that the ability of T. asahii to form a biofilm may be a major factor in determining persistence of the infection in spite of in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Land plants (embryophytes) evolved from streptophyte green algae, a small group of freshwater algae ranging from scaly, unicellular flagellates (Mesostigma) to complex, filamentous thalli with branching, cell differentiation and apical growth (Charales). Streptophyte algae and embryophytes form the division Streptophyta, whereas the remaining green algae are classified as Chlorophyta. The Charales (stoneworts) are often considered to be sister to land plants, suggesting progressive evolution towards cellular complexity within streptophyte green algae. Many cellular (e.g. phragmoplast, plasmodesmata, hexameric cellulose synthase, structure of flagellated cells, oogamous sexual reproduction with zygote retention) and physiological characters (e.g. type of photorespiration, phytochrome system) originated within streptophyte algae. RECENT PROGRESS: Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that Mesostigma (flagellate) and Chlorokybus (sarcinoid) form the earliest divergence within streptophytes, as sister to all other Streptophyta including embryophytes. The question whether Charales, Coleochaetales or Zygnematales are the sister to embryophytes is still (or, again) hotly debated. Projects to study genome evolution within streptophytes including protein families and polyadenylation signals have been initiated. In agreement with morphological and physiological features, many molecular traits believed to be specific for embryophytes have been shown to predate the Chlorophyta/Streptophyta split, or to have originated within streptophyte algae. Molecular phylogenies and the fossil record allow a detailed reconstruction of the early evolutionary events that led to the origin of true land plants, and shaped the current diversity and ecology of streptophyte green algae and their embryophyte descendants. CONCLUSIONS: The Streptophyta/Chlorophyta divergence correlates with a remarkably conservative preference for freshwater/marine habitats, and the early freshwater adaptation of streptophyte algae was a major advantage for the earliest land plants, even before the origin of the embryo and the sporophyte generation. The complete genomes of a few key streptophyte algae taxa will be required for a better understanding of the colonization of terrestrial habitats by streptophytes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microsatellite (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are widely used in plant breeding and genomic research. Thus, methods to improve the speed and efficiency of SSR and SNP genotyping are highly desirable. Here we describe a new method for multiplex PCR that facilitates fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for SNP assays. RESULTS: We show that multiplex-ready PCR can achieve a high (92\%) success rate for the amplification of published sequences under standardised reaction conditions, with a PCR specificity comparable to that of conventional PCR methods. We also demonstrate that multiplex-ready PCR supports an improved level of multiplexing in plant genomes of varying size and ploidy, without the need to carefully optimize assay conditions. Several advantages of multiplex-ready PCR for SSR and SNP genotyping are demonstrated and discussed. These include the uniform amplification of target sequences within multiplexed reactions and between independent assays, and the ability to label amplicons during PCR with specialised moieties such fluorescent dyes and biotin. CONCLUSION: Multiplex-ready PCR provides several technological advantages that can facilitate fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for SNP assays. These advantages can be captured at several points in the genotyping process, and offer considerable cost and labour savings. Multiplex-ready PCR is broadly applicable to plant genomics and marker assisted breeding, and should be transferable to any animal or plant species.},

The two fractions had similar composition and both of them were mainly composed of fucose, glucuronic acid, galactose, galacturonic acid, xylose, glucose, rhamnose and N-acetyl glucosamine. We monitored the entire EPS degradation, and also their components separately, during 35 days using pulse amperometric detection in a high-performance liquid chromatography. Fucose, galactose and especially glucose showed a faster degradation patt...},

Tr. beigelii was isolated in association with a recognized pathogen in 23 cases, 9 with a yeast, 14 with a dermatophyte. In 38 cases, Tr. beigelii was the only organism isolated when direct microscopic examination of clinical material showed the presence of hyphae and/or yeast cells. Although Tr. beigelii could only be assigned a definite pathogenic role in 6 cases of genital white piedra, and in one case of peritonitis associated with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, we believe that this organism was pathogenic in many cases of skin infection. In most of the cases where it was isolated from tissue or fluids at Royal North Shore Hospital, Tr. beigelii was not considered to be significantly contributing to the disease process.},

@article{Quail2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7\%. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant detection and accuracy.

RESULTS: Sequence generated by Ion Torrent, MiSeq and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour on GC-rich, neutral and moderately AT-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing the extremely AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the PGM, resulting in no coverage for approximately 30\% of the genome. We analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent data compared to MiSeq data, but at the expense of a higher false positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific errors were observed in both PGM and MiSeq data, but not in that from the Pacific Biosciences platform.

CONCLUSIONS: All three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate usable sequence. However there are key differences between the quality of that data and the applications it will support.},

abstract = {The terminal part of the inner medullary collecting duct exhibits a high degree of water permeability that is independent of increased intracellular cAMP and not accounted for by the activity of the known renal epithelial water channels CHIP28 (28-kDa channel-forming integral protein) and WCH-CD (collecting duct water channel protein). Starting with rat kidney papilla mRNA, reverse transcription PCR was performed with degenerate primers assuming that the putative channel would be a member of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family of proteins. A cDNA fragment was identified and used to screen a rat kidney cDNA library. A 1.9-kb cDNA clone was isolated. The open reading frame of 876 bp coded for a protein of 292 amino acids (M(r), 31,431). Aquaporin 3 (AQP3; 31.4-kDa water channel protein) is a newly discovered member of the MIP family. Northern blot analysis showed a single transcript for AQP3 of approximately 1.9 kb present in the renal medulla, predominantly in the inner medulla. With in situ hybridization, abundant message was found in the cells of the medullary collecting ducts. Injection of the complementary RNA of AQP3 into Xenopus oocytes markedly increased the osmotic water permeability. This permeability had an energy of activation of 3.0 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J), it was fully blocked by 1 mM p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, and this inhibition was reversed by 5 mM dithiothreitol. cAMP did not increase this water permeability. AQP3 did not permit passage of monovalent ions (Na, K, Cl); however, it is slightly permeable to urea. The present study demonstrates the existence of an additional water channel, AQP3, in epithelial cells of the medullary collecting duct.},

abstract = {Seventy-three strains of cryptophytes assigned to the genera Cryptomonas, Campylomonas or Chilomonas were studied by light microscopy, spectrophotometry and whole-mount electron microscopy. Twelve groups of strains were distinguished by light and whole mount electron microscopy using a combination of characters, mainly cell size, type of periplast and presence/absence and number of pyrenoids. However, characters previously used to distinguish Cryptomonas from Campylomonas (e.g. the type of periplast: polygonal periplast plates vs. a continuous periplast sheet) were found to occur together in dimorphic strains, indicating that periplast types relate to different life-history stages of a single taxon. To evaluate the taxonomic significance of the type of periplast and other characters previously used to distinguish genera and species, representatives of each strain group were subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses using two nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (ITS2, partial LSU rDNA) and a nucleomorph ribosomal gene (SSU rDNA). The results of the phylogenetic study provide molecular evidence for a life history-dependent dimorphism in the genus Cryptomonas: the genus Campylomonas represents the alternate morph of Cryptomonas. Campylomonas and Chilomonas are reduced to synonyms of Cryptomonas, the genus Cryptomonas is revised and typified, two new species are described and six species are emended.},

Sequence data also provided molecular signatures for taxa from genus to class level in the SSU rRNA secondary structure, revealed by a novel approach (search for non-homoplasious synapomorphies) and used for taxonomic diagnoses. Photosynthetic euglenoids and secondary heterotrophs formed a clade, designated as Euglenophyceae (emend.) with two orders: Euglenales and Eutreptiales. The mostly marine Eutreptiales (Eutreptia, Eutreptiella; not Distigma) comprised taxa with two or four emergent flagella (the quadriflagellate Tetreutreptia was integrated within Eutreptiella). The Euglenales (freshwater genera with < or = one emergent flagellum) formed nine clades and two individual branches (single strains); however, only two clades were congruent with traditional genera: Trachelomonas (incl. Strombomonas) and Colacium. Euglena was polyphyletic and diverged into four independent clades (intermixed with Astasia, Khawkinea and Lepocinclis) and two individual branches (e.g. E. polymorpha). Phacus was also subdivided into Phacus s. str. and two combined lineages (mixed with Lepocinclis spp. or Cryptoglena). In consequence, Euglena (s. str.), Phacus and other genera were emended and one lineage (mixed Phacus/Lepocinclis-clade) was recognized as the previously neglected genus Monomorphina Mereschkowsky (1877). The sister clade of Phacus s. str. (mixed Euglena/Lepocinclis-clade) was identified as Lepocinclis Perty (emended).},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Considerable attention has been directed in recent years toward the development of methods for the contextual analysis of expression data using interaction networks. Of particular interest has been the identification of active subnetworks by detecting regions enriched with differential expression. In contrast, however, very little effort has been made toward the application of comparable methods to other types of high-throughput data.

RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method based on co-clustering that is specifically designed for the exploratory analysis of large-scale, RNAi-based functional screens. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to a genome-scale dataset aimed at identifying host factors of the human pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition to recovering known cellular modules relevant to HCV infection, the results enabled us to identify new candidates and formulate biological hypotheses regarding possible roles and mechanisms for a number of them. For example, our analysis indicated that HCV, similar to other enveloped viruses, exploits elements within the endosomal pathway in order to acquire a membrane and facilitate assembly and release. This echoed a number of recent studies which showed that the ESCRT-III complex is essential to productive infection.

All proteins in the complex have been conserved during evolution, and genes that encode the exocyst subunits are present in the genomes of all plants investigated to date. Although the plant exocyst has not been studied in great detail, it is likely that the basic function of the exocyst in vesicle tethering is conserved. Nevertheless, genomic and genetic studies suggest that the exocyst complex in plants may have more diversified roles than that in budding yeast. In this review, we compare the knowledge about the exocyst in plant cells to the well-studied exocyst in budding yeast, in order to explore similarities and differences in expression and function between these organisms, both of which have walled cells.},

abstract = {The rapid identification of microbes responsible for bloodstream infections (BSIs) allows more focused and effective therapies and outcomes. DNA sequence-based methods offer an opportunity for faster, accurate diagnosis and for effective therapy. As our objective of the study, the ability of the Prove-it Sepsis platform, already proven as a rapid PCR- and microarray-based assay for the majority of sepsis-causing bacteria, was extended to also rapidly identify clinically relevant yeasts in blood culture. The performance characteristics of this extended platform are described. We found that the extended diagnostic Prove-it Sepsis platform was found to be highly accurate when analyzing primary isolates, spiked blood cultures, nucleic acid extracts from a retrospective blood culture data set, and primary blood cultures. Comparison of the blood culture results from the Prove-it Sepsis platform with those from conventional culture-based methods or by gene sequencing demonstrated a sensitivity of 99\% and a specificity of 98\% for fungal targets (based on analysis of a total of 388 specimens). Total assay time was 3 h from DNA extraction to BSI diagnosis. These results extend the performance characteristics of the Prove-it platform for bacteria to the easy, rapid, and accurate detection and species identification of yeasts in positive blood cultures. Incorporation of this extended and rapid diagnostic platform into the tools for clinical patient management would allow possibly faster identification and more focused therapies for BSIs.},

abstract = {Phylogeographical analyses have become commonplace for a myriad of organisms with the advent of cheap DNA sequencing technologies. Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA sequences and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA sequence data to reveal nested genetic population structures. We provide a direct interface to map the results from spatial clustering with Google Maps using the portal http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/ and illustrate this approach using sequence data from Borrelia burgdorferi. The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer. The tools that are introduced are freely available at http://www.helsinki.fi/bsg/software/BAPS/.},

abstract = {In searching for a basolateral membrane water transporter in rat kidney with homology to channel forming integral protein (CHIP28), water channel-collecting duct (WCH-CD), and mercurial-insensitive water channel (MIWC), we cloned a new member of the major intrinsic protein family (GLIP, GLycerol Intrinsic Protein). GLIP cDNA had an 855-base pair open reading frame encoding a 30.5-kDa protein with 19-23\% amino acid identity to the water channels and 36\% identity to the bacterial glycerol facilitator GlpF. Northern blot analysis showed a 5.5-kilobase mRNA encoding GLIP in kidney, brain, and lung; RT-PCR/Southern blot analysis indicated expression of GLIP in kidney, brain, lung, eye, colon, stomach, and skeletal muscle, but not in heart, liver, and spleen. In situ hybridization in rat kidney showed GLIP mRNA expression in medullary collecting duct. Immunofluorescence with a peptide-derived polyclonal antibody showed GLIP protein expression in basolateral membrane of kidney collecting duct principal cells and brain meningeal cells. Functional measurements in Xenopus oocytes expressing GLIP cRNA showed a > 20-fold increase in [3H]glycerol uptake compared with water-injected oocytes; glycerol uptake was inhibited 88\% by diisothiocyanodisulfonic stilbene (0.2 mM) and 36\% by phloretin (0.25 mM). GLIP did not function as a transporter for water, urea, inositol, glucose, lactate, and monovalent ions. Glycerol uptake in oocytes expressing CHIP28 and MIWC was not different from that in water-injected controls. GLIP represents the first mammalian water channel homolog that selectively transports a solute other than water. The physiological substrate(s) and role(s) of GLIP remain to be elucidated.},

We showed functionally that Wnt promotes oral and inhibits aboral development, as well as repressing the formation of additional Wnt-mediated oral organisers. It is possible to relate the role of Wnt in axial patterning to the broader question of how such a wide variety of body plans evolved from the eumetazoan ancestor, given the remarkably conserved genetic toolkit among metazoans. Our results demonstrate how even a slight initial change in a single gene's expression (temporal or spatial) could provide a radical body plan alteration on which natural selection may act and could eventually lead to the establishment of a new species.},

abstract = {Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is a pore-forming protein that is required for regulated reabsorption of water from urine. Mutations in AQP2 lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disorder in which functional AQP2 is not expressed on the apical cell surface of kidney collecting duct principal cells. The mechanisms and pathways directing AQP2 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex and beyond have not been defined. We found that approximately 25\% of newly synthesized AQP2 is glycosylated. Nonglycosylated and complex-glycosylated wild-type AQP2 are stable proteins with a half-life of 6-12 h and are both detectable on the cell surface. We show that AQP2 forms tetramers in the endoplasmic reticulum during or very early after synthesis and reaches the Golgi complex in 1-1.5 h. We also report that glycosylation is neither essential for tetramerization nor for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Instead, the N-linked glycan is important for exit from the Golgi complex and sorting of AQP2 to the plasma membrane. These results are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the intracellular retention of AQP2 in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.},

abstract = {Summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis (SHP) is type III or IV allergies developed by repeated inhalation of arthroconidia of Trichosporon species. We identified 105 strains obtained from the homes of 36 SHP patients by analysis of the intergenic spacer (IGS) 1 region, which is located between the 26S and 5S rRNA genes; in addition, we analyzed the IGS genotypes of the strains. Serologically, Trichosporon species are classified as serotype I, II, III, or I-III. Of the 105 strains, 43 (41.1\%), 53 (50.5\%), and 9 (8.6\%) strains were isolated as serotypes I, II, and III, respectively. Serotype I, II, and III strains were recovered from 19 (52.8\%), 29 (80.6\%), and 4 (11.1\%) of the 36 houses of SHP patients, respectively. No serotype I-III strains were isolated from the houses. Of 43 serotype I strains, 42 (97.7\%) were identified as Trichosporon dermatis, and the remaining one was T. terricola. Of 53 serotype II strains, 37 (69.8\%) were identified as T. asahii, and the remaining serotype II isolates were T. aquatile (1.9\%), T. coremiiforme (7.5\%), T. faecale (1.9\%), T. japonicum (15.1\%), and T. ovoides (3.8\%). There were nine serotype III strains comprised of T. montevideense (77.8\%) and T. domesticum (22.2\%). Intraspecies diversity was found only in T. asahii. This microorganism also causes opportunistic infections (trichosporonosis); seven genotypes of its IGS 1 region have been identified. While the strains of T. asahii obtained from Japanese patients with trichosporonosis were genotype I, the strains from the houses of SHP patients were genotype III. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the strains that play the most significant roles in the development of SHP are T. dermatis, T. asahii genotype 3, and T. montevideense, representing serotypes I, II, and III, respectively.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) generate millions of reads and hundreds of datasets, and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and distill such large amounts of data. Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the NGS and GWAS. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).

RESULTS: We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis (IPAD, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources.IPAD is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the BioCarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature curated, Reactome, CTD, PharmGKB, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and HOMER. The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ.Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.

CONCLUSIONS: IPAD is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current IPAD database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.},

@article{Komsic-Buchmann2012,
abstract = {Contractile vacuoles (CVs) are essential for osmoregulation in many protists. To investigate the mechanism of CV function in Chlamydomonas, we isolated novel osmoregulatory mutants. Four of the isolated mutant cell lines carried the same 33,641 base deletion, rendering the cell lines unable to grow under strong hypotonic conditions. One mutant cell line (Osmo75) was analyzed in detail. The CV morphology was variable in mutant cells, and most cells had multiple small CVs. In addition, one or two enlarged CVs or no visible CVs at all, were observed by light microscopy. These findings suggest that the mutant is impaired in homotypic vacuolar and exocytotic membrane fusion. Furthermore the mutants had long flagella. One of the affected genes is the only SEC6 homologue in Chlamydomonas (CreSEC6). The SEC6 protein is a component of the exocyst complex that is required for efficient exocytosis. Transformation of the Osmo75 mutant with a CreSEC6-GFP construct rescued the mutant completely (osmoregulation and flagellar length). Rescued strains overexpressed CreSEC6 (as a GFP-tagged protein) and displayed a modified CV activity. CVs were larger, whereas the CV contraction interval remained unchanged, leading to increased water efflux rates. Electron microscopy analysis of Osmo75 cells showed that the mutant is able to form the close contact zones between the plasma membrane and the CV membrane observed during late diastole and systole. These results indicate that CreSEC6 is essential for CV function and required for homotypic vesicle fusion during diastole and water expulsion during systole. In addition, CreSEC6 is not only necessary for CV function, but possibly influences the CV cycle in an indirect manner and flagellar length in Chlamydomonas.},

abstract = {The prototype baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, an insect pathogen, holds great potential as a gene therapy vector. To develop transductional targeting and gene delivery by baculovirus, we focused on characterizing the nature and regulation of its uptake in human cancer cells. Baculovirus entered the cells along fluid-phase markers from the raft areas into smooth-surfaced vesicles devoid of clathrin. Notably, regulators associated with macropinocytosis, namely EIPA, Pak1, Rab34, and Rac1, had no significant effect on viral transduction, and the virus did not induce fluid-phase uptake. The internalization and nuclear uptake was, however, affected by mutants of RhoA, and of Arf6, a regulator of clathrin-independent entry. Furthermore, the entry of baculovirus induced ruffle formation and triggered the uptake of fluorescent E. coli bioparticles. To conclude, baculovirus enters human cells via a clathrin-independent pathway, which is able to trigger bacterial uptake. This study increases our understanding of virus entry strategies and gives new insight into baculovirus-mediated gene delivery in human cells.},

More recently, the pathogenic role of these and other fungi has been clearly established. Three diverse groups of fungi are responsible for these emerging infections: the agents of phaeohyphomycosis and hyalohyphomycosis and certain yeasts. Reports of the emergence of these organisms as significant pathogens may be ascribed to increasing awareness by physicians and microbiologists, aggressive culture of patient specimens, increasingly cytotoxic chemotherapy, and selection of resistant organisms by the widespread empirical use of amphotericin B. Infections with these fungi tend to be disseminated and are frequently fatal in immunocompromised hosts. Treatment of these infections is not standardized. Experimental therapy in murine models of fungal infections suggests a role for newer agents, combination antifungal chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.},

The MFEprimer-2.0 server allows users to check primer specificity against genomic DNA and messenger RNA/complementary DNA sequence databases quickly and easily. MFEprimer-2.0 uses a k-mer index algorithm to accelerate the search process for primer binding sites and uses thermodynamics to evaluate binding stability between each primer and its DNA template. Several important characteristics, such as the sequence, melting temperature and size of each amplicon, either specific or non-specific, are reported on the results page. Based on these characteristics and the user-friendly output, users can readily draw conclusions about the specificity of PCR primers. Analyses for degenerate primers and multiple PCR primers are also supported in MFEprimer-2.0. In addition, the databases supported by MFEprimer-2.0 are comprehensive, and custom databases can also be supported on request. The MFEprimer-2.0 server does not require a login and is freely available at http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0.

ARF6, a small molecular weight GTPase, regulates the processes of endocytosis and endocytic recycling in concert with various effector molecules and other small GTPases. This review highlights three critical processes that involve ARF6-mediated endosomal membrane trafficking-cell motility, cytokinesis, and cholesterol homeostasis. In each case, the function of ARF6-mediated trafficking varies-including localization of specific protein and lipid cargo, regulation of bulk membrane movement, and modulation of intracellular signaling. As described in this review, mis-regulation of endocytic traffic can result in human disease when it compromises the cell's ability to regulate cell movement and invasion, cell division, and lipid homeostasis.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G-proteins are intracellular partners of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs act on inactive Galpha.GDP/Gbetagamma heterotrimers to promote GDP release and GTP binding, resulting in liberation of Galpha from Gbetagamma. Galpha.GTP and Gbetagamma target effectors including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases and ion channels. Signaling is terminated by intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha and heterotrimer reformation - a cycle accelerated by 'regulators of G-protein signaling' (RGS proteins). Recent studies have identified several unconventional G-protein signaling pathways that diverge from this standard model. Whereas phospholipase C (PLC) beta is activated by Galpha(q) and Gbetagamma, novel PLC isoforms are regulated by both heterotrimeric and Ras-superfamily G-proteins. An Arabidopsis protein has been discovered containing both GPCR and RGS domains within the same protein. Most surprisingly, a receptor-independent Galpha nucleotide cycle that regulates cell division has been delineated in both Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we revisit classical heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and explore these new, non-canonical G-protein signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Unlike most Hox cluster genes, with their canonical role in anterior-posterior patterning of the embryo, the Hox3 orthologue of insects has diverged. Here, we investigate the zen orthologue in Oncopeltus fasciatus (Hemiptera:Heteroptera). As in other insects, the Of-zen gene is expressed extraembryonically, and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments demonstrate that it is functionally required in this domain for the proper occurrence of katatrepsis, the phase of embryonic movements by which the embryo emerges from the yolk and adjusts its orientation within the egg. After RNAi knockdown of Of-zen, katatrepsis does not occur, causing embryos to complete development inside out. However, not all aspects of expression and function are conserved compared to grasshopper, beetle, and fly orthologues. Of-zen is not expressed in the extraembryonic tissue until relatively late, suggesting it is not involved in tissue specification. Within the extraembryonic domain, Of-zen is expressed in the outer serosal membrane, but unlike orthologues, it is not detectable in the inner extraembryonic membrane, the amnion. Thus, the role of zen in the interaction of serosa, amnion, and embryo may differ between species. Of-zen is also expressed in the blastoderm, although this early expression shows no apparent correlation with defects seen by RNAi knockdown.},

GSH levels were measured with HPLC and did not differ between the different treatments or the control. According to the metallo-thiolomics concept, mass spectrometry was used as a method for unambiguous thiol peptide identification. PC2, PC3 and PC4 were clearly identified in the Cd stressed sample with UPLC-MS by their MS spectrum and molecular masses. PC2 and PC3 were determined to be the main thiol compounds, while PC4 was only abundant in traces in Micrasterias. In addition, the identity of PC2 and PC3 was confirmed by MS/MS. No PCs were detected in the Cu stressed algae sample. However, in the Cr stressed sample traces of PC2 were indicated by a peak in UPLC-MS at the retention time of the PC2 standard, but the intensity was too low to acquire reliable MS and MS/MS spectra. In this study PCs have been detected for the first time in a green alga of the division Streptophyta, a close relative to higher plants.},

abstract = {Following recent improvements in sequencing technologies, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is positioned to become an essential tool in the control of antibiotic resistance, a major threat in modern healthcare. WGS has already found numerous applications in this area, ranging from the development of novel antibiotics and diagnostic tests through to antibiotic stewardship of currently available drugs via surveillance and the elucidation of the factors that allow the emergence and persistence of resistance. Numerous proof-of-principle studies have also highlighted the value of WGS as a tool for day-to-day infection control and, for some pathogens, as a primary diagnostic tool to detect antibiotic resistance. However, appropriate data analysis platforms will need to be developed before routine WGS can be introduced on a large scale.},

Nine novel clades and single-taxon branches were identified, suggesting that current taxon sampling has not reached saturation in the family. The highly polyphyletic nature of most desmid genera corroborated in this study using a large taxon set, calls for re-evaluation of the genus concept in the family Desmidiaceae that traditionally relied on features of cell morphology. Molecular phylogenetic data have shown that these morphological characters are highly homoplastic or plesiomorphic and thus cannot be used to delineate genera. The dramatic discrepancy between the currently practised systematic treatment of the family and the composition of the clades based on sequence comparisons requires emendation of almost all existing genera and description of a larger number of novel genera. The clades identified during this study provide a framework for the future emendation/description of genera in the Desmidiaceae.},

abstract = {Although the combination of different genes in phylogenetic analyses is a promising approach, the methodology is not well established and analyses often suffer from inadequate, noncongruent taxon sampling, long-branch attraction, or conflicting evolutionary models of the genes analyzed. Conflicts or congruence between multigene and single-gene phylogenies, as well as the assumed superiority of the multigene approach, are often difficult to assess solely because of incongruent taxon sampling. In the present study, a data set of 43 nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA and plastid-encoded rbcL gene sequences was generated from the same strains of conjugating green algae (Zygnematophyceae, Streptophyta). Phylogenetic analyses used the genes individually and in combination, either as concatenated sequences or with the log-likelihood summation method. Single-gene analyses, although mostly congruent, revealed some conflicting nodes and showed different patterns of statistical support. Combined analyses confidently resolved the conflicts between the single-gene analyses, enhanced phylogenetic resolution, and were better supported by morphological information. Long-branch taxa were not the same for the two genes analyzed, and, thus, their effect on phylogenetic resolution was minimized in the combined analyses.},

abstract = {Health care-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant organisms represents a major therapeutic challenge. Unfortunately, treatment is dependent on empirical therapy, which often leads to improper and inadequate antimicrobial therapy. A rapid multiplex PCR-based Unyvero pneumonia application (UPA) assay that assists in timely decision-making has recently become available. In this study, we evaluated the performance of UPA in detecting etiological pathogens and resistance markers in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The impact of this assay on the management of severe nosocomial pneumonia was also assessed. Appropriate specimens were processed by UPA according to the manufacturer's protocol in parallel with conventional culture methods. Of the 56 patients recruited into the study, 49 (87.5\%) were evaluable. Of these, 27 (55.1\%) and 4 (8.2\%) harbored multiple bacteria by the PCR assay and conventional culture, respectively. A single pathogen was detected in 8 (16.3\%) and 4 (8.2\%) patients, respectively. Thirteen different genes were detected from 38 patients, including the ermB gene (40.8\%), the blaOXA-51-like gene (28.6\%), the sul1 (28.6\%) and int1 (20.4\%) integrase genes, and the mecA and blaCTX-M genes (12.3\% each). The time from sample testing to results was 4 h versus 48 to 96 h by UPA and culture, respectively. Initial empirical treatment was changed within 5 to 6 h in 33 (67.3\%) patients based on the availability of UPA results. Thirty (62.2\%) of the patients improved clinically. A total of 3 (6.1\%) patients died, mainly from their comorbidities. These data demonstrate the potential of a multiplex PCR-based assay for accurate and timely detection of etiological agents of NP, multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and resistance markers, which can guide clinicians in making early antibiotic adjustments.},

abstract = {Regulatory networks composed of interacting genes are responsible for pattern formation and cell type specification in a wide variety of developmental contexts. Evolution must act on these regulatory networks in order to change the proportions, distribution, and characteristics of specified cells. Thus, understanding how these networks operate in homologous systems across multiple levels of phylogenetic divergence is critical for understanding the evolution of developmental systems. Among the most thoroughly characterized regulatory networks is the dorsal-ventral patterning system of the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Due to the thorough understanding of this system, it is an ideal starting point for comparative analyses. Here we report an analysis of the DV patterning system of the wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. This wasp undergoes a mode of long germ embryogenesis that is superficially nearly identical to that of Drosophila, but one that was likely independently derived. We have found that while the expression of genes just prior to the onset of gastrulation is almost identical in Nasonia and Drosophila, both the upstream network responsible for generating this pattern, and the downstream morphogenetic movements that it sets in motion, are significantly diverged. From this we conclude that many network structures are available to evolution to achieve particular developmental ends.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming available as a routine tool for clinical microbiology. If applied directly on clinical samples, this could further reduce diagnostic times and thereby improve control and treatment. A major bottleneck is the availability of fast and reliable bioinformatic tools. This study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of WGS directly on clinical samples and to develop easy-to-use bioinformatic tools for the analysis of sequencing data. Thirty-five random urine samples from patients with suspected urinary tract infections were examined using conventional microbiology, WGS of isolated bacteria, and direct sequencing on pellets from the urine samples. A rapid method for analyzing the sequence data was developed. Bacteria were cultivated from 19 samples but in pure cultures from only 17 samples. WGS improved the identification of the cultivated bacteria, and almost complete agreement was observed between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibilities. Complete agreement was observed between species identification, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic relationships for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis isolates when the results of WGS of cultured isolates and urine samples were directly compared. Sequencing directly from the urine enabled bacterial identification in polymicrobial samples. Additional putative pathogenic strains were observed in some culture-negative samples. WGS directly on clinical samples can provide clinically relevant information and drastically reduce diagnostic times. This may prove very useful, but the need for data analysis is still a hurdle to clinical implementation. To overcome this problem, a publicly available bioinformatic tool was developed in this study.},

abstract = {The genus Chlamydomonas (including Chloromonas) is one of the largest green algal genera comprising more than 600 species. To initiate a comprehensive analysis of the phylogeny and systematics of the genus, we determined nuclear-encoded SSU rRNA sequences from 32 strains of Chlamydomonas, Chloromonas and Chlorogonium with emphasis on oogamous taxa and related strains, and incorporated these into global molecular phylogenetic analyses of 132 strains of Chlorophyceae. In addition, we studied the morphology and reproduction of oogamous and related strains by light microscopy. We recognize and designate 18 monophyletic lineages (clades) within the Chlorophyceae, 11 of which are confined to the CW (basal bodies displaced clockwise) subgroup. The majority of clades recognized within the Chlorophyceae do not correspond to any of the traditional classification systems, which are still largely based on the organization level. Strains assigned to Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas were found in seven different clades confirming the polyphyly of the two genera as presently conceived. To initiate the taxonomic revision of Chlamydomonas, C. reinhardtii is proposed as the conserved type of the genus. In consequence, species in clades other than the clade containing C. reinhardtii must be transferred to other genera, a process initiated in this contribution. The oogamous strains studied represent a monophyletic lineage, which is described as Oogamochlamys gen. nov. comprising three species (O. gigantea, O. zimbabwiensis and O. ettlii spec. nov.). The sister clade to Oogamochlamys consists of isogamous strains characterized by chloroplasts with incisions and is described as Lobochlamys gen. nov. with two species (L. culleus and L. segnis). Another clade is characterized by asteroid or perforated, parietal chloroplasts and contains the type species of Chloromonas (C. reticulata). Thus, the polyphyletic Chloromonas (traditionally defined as "Chlamydomonas without pyrenoids") can be legitimized as a monophyletic genus by restriction to this clade and is here emended on the basis of chloroplast characters (the clade contains strains with or without pyrenoids thus rejecting the character "absence of pyrenoids").},

We have developed a generic method for the identification of SUMO acceptor lysines in target proteins. We have identified 103 SUMO-2 acceptor lysines in endogenous target proteins. Of these acceptor lysines, 76 are situated in the SUMOylation consensus site [VILMFPC]KxE. Interestingly, eight sites fit the inverted SUMOylation consensus motif [ED]xK[VILFP]. In addition, we found direct mass spectrometric evidence for crosstalk between SUMOylation and phosphorylation with a preferred spacer between the SUMOylated lysine and the phosphorylated serine of four residues. In 16 proteins we identified a hydrophobic cluster SUMOylation motif (HCSM). SUMO conjugation of RanGAP1 and ZBTB1 via HCSMs is remarkably efficient.},

Conventional mycological studies were not adequate for the identification of the isolate at the species level. In our second case as in the first one, the isolate was identified as T. asahii with 99.9\% accuracy by API 20C AUX. Although two T. asahii isolates from the same patient yielded identical typing profiles by arbitrary primed-PCR, the isolates of the two different patients showed different arbitrary primed-PCR typing profiles.

Despite the availability of efficient methods for introduction of foreign genes into the nuclear genome of the alga, transgene expression levels are usually very poor. This is a serious limitation that has severely hampered both post-genomics research in Chlamydomonas and use of the alga in molecular farming. Here we report a solution to this problem. We have designed a genetic screen that facilitates isolation of algal strains that efficiently express introduced transgenes. The levels of accumulation of foreign protein in our expression strains are almost uniformly high in all transgenic clones and are little influenced by position effects. The possibility of expressing transgenes to high levels will greatly facilitate post-genomics research in Chlamydomonas, and will also boost exploitation of the alga as an inexpensive production host for biopharmaceuticals and other valuable compounds.},

However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed >430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

In order to understand the ancestral function of Brachyury we cloned NemBra1, a Brachyury homolog from the anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Anthozoa are considered the basal group among the Cnidaria. First NemBra1 expression could be detected at the blastula/gastrula transition and gene activity persists until adulthood of the animals. In situ hybridization shows that NemBra1 expression in gastrulae and early planula larvae is restricted to a circle around the blastopore. When the larvae begin to metamorphose into primary polyps, the expression zone extends into the developing mesenteries. In adult polyps Brachyury expression persists in the mesenteries, but is excluded from the septal filament and the differentiated retractor muscles, which also develop from the mesenteries. We conclude that the ancestral function of Brachyury was in specifying the blastopore and its endodermal derivatives.},

abstract = {The PARKIN ubiquitin ligase (also known as PARK2) and its regulatory kinase PINK1 (also known as PARK6), often mutated in familial early-onset Parkinson's disease, have central roles in mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy. Whereas PARKIN is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon depolarization via PINK1 action and can ubiquitylate porin, mitofusin and Miro proteins on the MOM, the full repertoire of PARKIN substrates--the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome--remains poorly defined. Here we use quantitative diGly capture proteomics (diGly) to elucidate the ubiquitylation site specificity and topology of PARKIN-dependent target modification in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Hundreds of dynamically regulated ubiquitylation sites in dozens of proteins were identified, with strong enrichment for MOM proteins, indicating that PARKIN dramatically alters the ubiquitylation status of the mitochondrial proteome. Using complementary interaction proteomics, we found depolarization-dependent PARKIN association with numerous MOM targets, autophagy receptors, and the proteasome. Mutation of the PARKIN active site residue C431, which has been found mutated in Parkinson's disease patients, largely disrupts these associations. Structural and topological analysis revealed extensive conservation of PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylation sites on cytoplasmic domains in vertebrate and Drosophila melanogaster MOM proteins. These studies provide a resource for understanding how the PINK1-PARKIN pathway re-sculpts the proteome to support mitochondrial homeostasis.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a prevalent post-transcriptional process, which is not only important to normal cellular function but is also involved in human diseases. The newly developed second generation sequencing technique provides high-throughput data (RNA-seq data) to study alternative splicing events in different types of cells. Here, we present a computational method, SpliceMap, to detect splice junctions from RNA-seq data. This method does not depend on any existing annotation of gene structures and is capable of finding novel splice junctions with high sensitivity and specificity. It can handle long reads (50-100 nt) and can exploit paired-read information to improve mapping accuracy. Several parameters are included in the output to indicate the reliability of the predicted junction and help filter out false predictions. We applied SpliceMap to analyze 23 million paired 50-nt reads from human brain tissue. The results show at this depth of sequencing, RNA-seq can support reliable detection of splice junctions except for those that are present at very low level. Compared to current methods, SpliceMap can achieve 12\% higher sensitivity without sacrificing specificity.},

abstract = {Acid mine drainage pollution may be associated with large water volume flows and exceptionally long periods of time over which the drainage may require treatment. While the use and role of sulphate reducing bacteria has been demonstrated in active treatment systems for acid mine drainage remediation, reactor size requirement and the cost and availability of the carbon and electron donor source are factors which constrain process development. Little attention has focussed on the use of waste stabilisation ponding processes for acid mine drainage treatment. Wastewater ponding is a mature technology for the treatment of large water volumes and its use as a basis for appropriate reactor design for acid mine drainage treatment is described including high rates of sulphate reduction and the precipitation of metal sulphides. Together with the co-disposal of organic wastes, algal biomass is generated as an independent carbon source for SRB production. Treatment of tannery effluent in a custom-designed high rate algal ponding process, and its use as a carbon source in the generation and precipitation of metal sulphides, has been demonstrated through piloting to the implementation of a full-scale process. The treatment of both mine drainage and zinc refinery wastewaters are reported. A complementary role for microalgal production in the generation of alkalinity and bioadsorptive removal of metals has been utilised and an Integrated 'Algal Sulphate Reducing Ponding Process for the Treatment of Acidic and Metal Wastewaters' (ASPAM) has been described.},

Furthermore, no discrete phycobilisome-type aggregates have thus far been observed in the Cryptophyceae. Structurally, although not necessarily functionally, this is a radical difference. The width of the intrathylakoidal spaces can vary but is generally about 200-300 A. While the thylakoid membranes are usually closely aligned, grana-type fusions do not occur. In Chroomonas these membranes evidence an extensive periodic display with a spacing on the order of 140-160 A.

Also, the new version can take into account the effects of divalent cations, which are included in most PCR buffers. Another modification enables using lowercase masked template sequences for primer design.

However, analyses of 71 concatenated plastid proteins [Turmel et al. (2009): Mol. Biol. Evol. 26: 2317-2331] recovered Pedinomonas within the Chlorellales (Trebouxiophyceae), thereby questioning the Pedinophyceae as an independent class. For the present study, complete nuclear and plastid-encoded rRNA operon sequences have been determined for 37 taxa of green algae including 6 members of the Pedinophyceae, providing 9272 aligned nucleotide positions. Phylogenies using both rRNA operons consistently rejected any relationship between Pedinophyceae and the Chlorellales. Instead, the Pedinophyceae were significantly resolved as sister of all phycoplast-containing 'core' chlorophytes, i.e. Chlorodendrophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Reinvestigation of plastid proteins discovered biased phylogenetic signal among protein partitions, indicating the published Pedinomonas + Chlorellales association as likely artificial. Marine pedinophytes (Resultomonas and Marsupiomonas; Marsupiomonadales ord. nov.), formed a sister clade to the order Pedinomonadales, occurring in freshwater and soil habitats. Synapomorphies in rRNA secondary structures were integrated in taxonomic diagnoses of the Pedinophyceae and were also used for BLAST searches targeting environmental sequence databases. The latter approach revealed conserved habitat preferences for the Marsupiomonadales and Pedinomonadales, and identified several novel pedinophyte lineages.},

abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

abstract = {Most freshwater flagellates use contractile vacuoles (CVs) to expel excess water. We have used Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a green model system to investigate CV function during adaptation to osmotic changes in culture medium. We show that the contractile vacuole in Chlamydomonas is regulated in two different ways. The size of the contractile vacuoles increases during cell growth, with the contraction interval strongly depending on the osmotic strength of the medium. In contrast, there are only small fluctuations in cytosolic osmolarity and plasma membrane permeability. Modeling of the CV membrane permeability indicates that only a small osmotic gradient is necessary for water flux into the CV, which is most likely facilitated by the aquaporin major intrinsic protein 1 (MIP1). We show that MIP1 is localized to the contractile vacuole, and that the expression rate and protein level of MIP1 exhibit only minor fluctuations under different osmotic conditions. In contrast, SEC6, a protein of the exocyst complex that is required for the water expulsion step, and a dynamin-like protein are upregulated under strong hypotonic conditions. Overexpression of a CreMIP1-GFP construct did not change the physiology of the CV. The functional implications of these results are discussed.},

The acidic polysaccharide fraction from a green alga Coccomyxa gloeobotrydiformi (CmAPS) was isolated and the antiviral action on an in vitro infection of influenza A virus was examined. CmAPS inhibited the growth and yield of all influenza A virus strains tested, such as A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 pandemic strains. The 50\% inhibitory concentration of CmAPS on the infection of human influenza A virus strains ranged from 26 to 70 µg/mL and the antiviral activity of CmAPS against influenza A/USSR90/77 (H1N1) was the strongest. The antiviral activity of CmAPS was not due to the cytotoxicity against host cells. The antiviral activity of CmAPS required its presence in the inoculation of virus onto MDCK cells. Pretreatment and post-treatment with CmAPS was ineffective for the antiviral activity. CmAPS inhibited influenza A virus-induced erythrocyte hemagglutination and hemolysis. Taken together, CmAPS was suggested to exhibit the anti-influenza virus activity through preventing the interaction of virus and host cells. The detailed antiviral activity of CmAPS is discussed.},

LPS is composed of three main parts, an O-antigen, lipid A, and a core region, all of which display immense structural variations among different bacterial species. These components not only provide cell integrity but also elicit an immune response in the host, which ranges from other marine organisms to humans. Toll-like receptor 4 and its homologs are the dedicated receptors that detect LPS and trigger the immune system to respond, often causing a wide variety of inflammatory diseases and even death. This review describes the structural organization of selected LPSes and their association with economically important diseases in marine organisms. In addition, the potential therapeutic use of LPS as an immune adjuvant in different diseases is highlighted.},

Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

abstract = {Trichosporon spp. are basidiomycetous yeast-like fungi found widely in nature. Clinical isolates are generally related to superficial infections. However, this fungus has been recognized as an opportunistic agent of invasive infections, mostly in cancer patients and those exposed to invasive medical procedures. It is possible that the ability of Trichosporon strains to form biofilms on implanted devices, the presence of glucuronoxylomannan in their cell walls, and the ability to produce proteases and lipases are all factors likely related to the virulence of this genus and therefore may account for the progress of invasive trichosporonosis. Disseminated trichosporonosis has been increasingly reported worldwide and represents a challenge for both diagnosis and species identification. Phenotypic identification methods are useful for Trichosporon sp. screening, but only molecular methods, such as IGS region sequencing, allow the complete identification of Trichosporon isolates at the species level. Methods for the diagnosis of invasive trichosporonosis include PCR-based methods, Luminex xMAP technology, and, more recently, proteomics. Treating patients with trichosporonosis remains a challenge because of limited data on the in vitro and in vivo activities of antifungal drugs against clinically relevant species of the genus. Despite the mentioned limitations, the use of antifungal regimens containing triazoles appears to be the best therapeutic approach.},

Applying such an approach, however, is hampered by the need for reference sequences and by mutational loads that confound the unambiguous identification of causal mutations. Here we introduce NIKS (needle in the k-stack), a reference-free algorithm based on comparing k-mers in whole-genome sequencing data for precise discovery of homozygous mutations. We applied NIKS to eight mutants induced in nonreference rice cultivars and to two mutants of the nonmodel species Arabis alpina. In both species, comparing pooled F2 individuals selected for mutant phenotypes revealed small sets of mutations including the causal changes. Moreover, comparing M3 seedlings of two allelic mutants unambiguously identified the causal gene. Thus, for any species amenable to mutagenesis, NIKS enables forward genetics without requiring segregating populations, genetic maps and reference sequences.},

abstract = {The Cryptophyta comprise photoautotrophic protists with complex plastids which harbor a remnant eukaryotic nucleus (nucleomorph) and a few heterotrophic taxa which either lack a plastid (Goniomonas) or contain a complex plastid devoid of pigments (Ieucoplast; Chilomonas). To resolve the phylogenetic relationships between photosynthetic, leucoplast-containing and aplastidial taxa, we determined complete nuclear-encoded SSU rRNA-sequences from 12 cryptophyte taxa representing the genera Cryptomonas, Chilomonas, Rhodomonas, Chroomonas, Hemiselmis, Proteomonas and Teleaulax and, as an outgroup taxon, Cyanoptyche gloeocystis (Glaucocystophyta). Phylogenetic analyses of SSU rRNA sequences from a total of 24 cryptophyte taxa rooted with 4 glaucocystophyte taxa using distance, parsimony and likelihood methods as well as LogDet transformations invariably position the aplastidial genus Goniomonas as a sister taxon to a monophyletic lineage consisting of all plastid containing cryptophytes including Chilomonas. Among the plastid-containing taxa, we identify six major clades each supported by high bootstrap values: clade I (Cryptomonas and Chilomonas), clade II (Rhodomonas, Pyrenomonas, Rhinomonas and Storeatula), clade III (Guillardia and the 'unidentified cryptophyte' strain CCMP 325), clade IV (Teleaulax and Geminigera), clade V (Proteomonas) and clade VI (Hemiselmis, Chroomonas and Komma). Clade I (Cryptomonas and Chilomonas) represents a sister group to clades II-VI which together form a monophyletic lineage; the phylogenetic relationships between clades II-VI remain largely unresolved. Chilomonas is positioned within the Cryptomonas clade and thus presumably evolved from a photosynthetic taxon of this genus. In our analysis the characters blue and red pigmentation do not correspond with a basal subdivision of the phylum, thus rejecting this character for higher-level classification of cryptophytes. However, different spectroscopic subtypes of phycoerythrin (PE I-III) and phycocyanin (PC II-IV) represent informative characters at a lower taxonomic level. Phycocyanin types are confined to the later diverging clade VI and within Hemiselmis, a species with phycocyanin is monophyletic with two species containing phycoerythrin. This supports previous molecular studies which demonstrated that the $\beta$ subunit of all cryptophyte biliproteins, regardless of spectroscopic type, is phylogenetically derived from the red algal $\beta$-phycoerythrin gene family, therefore the cryptophyte phycocyanins presumably originated by chromophore replacement from phycoerythrin. Our phylogenetic analysis does not support a previous suggestion that the aplastidial cryptophyte Goniomonas evolved from an ancestor containing a complex cryptomonadtype plastid by nucleomorph and plastid loss.},

Here, we predicted 18S rRNA primers based on consecutive conserved sites and evaluated their coverage efficiency and scope of application to different eukaryotic groups. After evaluation, eight of them were considered as qualified 18S primers based on coverage rate. Next, we examined common conserved regions in prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences to design 16S/18S universal primers. Three 16S/18S candidate primers, U515, U1390 and U1492, were then considered to be suitable for simultaneous amplification of the rRNA sequences in three domains. Eukaryotic 18S and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes in a sponge were amplified simultaneously using universal primers U515 and U1390, and the subsequent sorting of pyrosequenced reads revealed some distinctive communities in different parts of the sample. The real difference in biodiversity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts could be discerned as the dissimilarity between OTUs was increased from 0.005 to 0.1. A network of the communities in external and internal parts of the sponge illustrated the co-variation of some unique microbes in certain parts of the sponge, suggesting that the universal primers are useful in simultaneous detection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities.},

abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon analysis remains the standard approach for the cultivation-independent investigation of microbial diversity. The accuracy of these analyses depends strongly on the choice of primers. The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the SILVA 16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef 108 NR). Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, ≥ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies.},

abstract = {We have developed an efficient strategy that combines immunoglobulin (Ig) gene repertoire analysis and Ig reactivity profiling at the single cell level. Based on surface marker expression individual cells at different stages of human B cell development are isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For each cell Ig heavy and corresponding Ig light chain gene transcripts are amplified by nested RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors to produce monoclonal human antibodies of the same specificity in vitro. All reactions are performed in 96-well plates and allow cloning of large numbers of Ig genes. The recombinant antibodies are tested for reactivity with diverse self- and non-self antigens and the reactivity profile can be directly linked to the complete Ig heavy and Ig light chain gene sequence information that is obtained as part of the cloning strategy. In summary, our method to clone and express human monoclonal antibodies is unbiased, highly efficient, requires only small cell numbers and the recombinant antibodies allow direct conclusions on the frequency of specific human B cells in a diverse repertoire.},

abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a basic molecular biology technique with a multiplicity of uses, including deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and sequencing, functional analysis of genes, diagnosis of diseases, genotyping and discovery of genetic variants. Reliable primer design is crucial for successful PCR, and for over a decade, the open-source Primer3 software has been widely used for primer design, often in high-throughput genomics applications. It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3's functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement-a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

abstract = {Water transport in highly water-permeable membranes is conducted by water-selective pores--namely, water channels. The recent cloning of water channels revealed the water-selective characteristics of these proteins when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or reconstituted in liposomes. Currently, it is assumed that the function of water channels is to transport only water. We now report the cloning of a member of the water channel that also transports nonionic small molecules such as urea and glycerol. We named this channel aquaporin 3 (AQP3) for its predominant water permeability. AQP3 has amino acid sequence identity with major intrinsic protein (MIP) family proteins including AQP-channel-forming integral membrane protein, AQP-collecting duct, MIP, AQP-gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, nodulin 26, and glycerol facilitator (33-42\%). Thus, AQP3 is an additional member of the MIP family. Osmotic water permeability of Xenopus oocytes measured by videomicroscopy was 10-fold higher in oocytes injected with AQP3 transcript than with water-injected oocytes. The increase in osmotic water permeability was inhibited by HgCl2, and this effect was reversed by a reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Although to a smaller degree, AQP3 also facilitated the transport of nonionic small solutes such as urea and glycerol, while the previously cloned water channels are permeable only to water when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. AQP3 mRNA was expressed abundantly in kidney medulla and colon. In kidney, it was exclusively immunolocalized at the basolateral membrane of collecting duct cells. AQP3 may function as a water and urea exit mechanism in antidiuresis in collecting duct cells.},

@article{Caisova2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The second Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS2) is a fast evolving part of the nuclear-encoded rRNA operon located between the 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes. Based on crossing experiments it has been proposed that even a single Compensatory Base Change (CBC) in helices 2 and 3 of the ITS2 indicates sexual incompatibility and thus separates biological species. Taxa without any CBC in these ITS2 regions were designated as a 'CBC clade'. However, in depth comparative analyses of ITS2 secondary structures, ITS2 phylogeny, the origin of CBCs, and their relationship to biological species have rarely been performed. To gain 'close-up' insights into ITS2 evolution, (1) 86 sequences of ITS2 including secondary structures have been investigated in the green algal order Ulvales (Chlorophyta, Viridiplantae), (2) after recording all existing substitutions, CBCs and hemi-CBCs (hCBCs) were mapped upon the ITS2 phylogeny, rather than merely comparing ITS2 characters among pairs of taxa, and (3) the relation between CBCs, hCBCs, CBC clades, and the taxonomic level of organisms was investigated in detail.

RESULTS: High sequence and length conservation allowed the generation of an ITS2 consensus secondary structure, and introduction of a novel numbering system of ITS2 nucleotides and base pairs. Alignments and analyses were based on this structural information, leading to the following results: (1) in the Ulvales, the presence of a CBC is not linked to any particular taxonomic level, (2) most CBC 'clades' sensu Coleman are paraphyletic, and should rather be termed CBC grades. (3) the phenetic approach of pairwise comparison of sequences can be misleading, and thus, CBCs/hCBCs must be investigated in their evolutionary context, including homoplasy events (4) CBCs and hCBCs in ITS2 helices evolved independently, and we found no evidence for a CBC that originated via a two-fold hCBC substitution.

CONCLUSIONS: Our case study revealed several discrepancies between ITS2 evolution in the Ulvales and generally accepted assumptions underlying ITS2 evolution as e.g. the CBC clade concept. Therefore, we developed a suite of methods providing a critical 'close-up' view into ITS2 evolution by directly tracing the evolutionary history of individual positions, and we caution against a non-critical use of the ITS2 CBC clade concept for species delimitation.},

abstract = {Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) can enter cells via endocytic pathways or direct fusion at the plasma membrane depending on the cell line and receptor(s). Most studies into virus entry have used cultured fibroblasts but since keratinocytes represent the primary entry site for HSV-1 infection in its human host, we initiated studies to characterize the entry pathway of HSV-1 into human keratinocytes. Electron microscopy studies visualized free capsids in the cytoplasm and enveloped virus particles in vesicles suggesting viral uptake both by direct fusion at the plasma membrane and by endocytic vesicles. The ratio of the two entry modes differed in primary human keratinocytes and in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Inhibitor studies further support a role for endocytosis during HSV-1 entry. Infection was inhibited by the cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin, which demonstrates the requirement for host cholesterol during virus entry. Since the dynamin-specific inhibitor dynasore and overexpression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant blocked infection, we conclude that the entry pathways into keratinocytes are dynamin-mediated. Electron microscopy studies confirmed that virus uptake is completely blocked when the GTPase activity of dynamin is inhibited. Ex vivo infection of murine epidermis that was treated with dynasore further supports the essential role of dynamin during entry into the epithelium. Thus, we conclude that HSV-1 can enter human keratinocytes by alternative entry pathways that require dynamin and host cholesterol.},

We studied the incidence of colonization and systemic infection with these organisms in 353 highly immunocompromised patients over a 37-month period. Thirteen patients (3.7\%) had positive surveillance cultures for Trichosporon species in stool, skin, or urine. Three of the 13 patients developed systemic infections after having positive surveillance cultures. In two of these three patients, urine cultures were positive near the time of systemic infection. The route of entry appeared to have been enteric in two patients and cutaneous in one patient. Both colonizing and infecting organisms showed in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B and nystatin. This study suggests that positive surveillance cultures for Trichosporon species may correlate with systemic infection in the severely immunocompromised patient and that repeated positive urine cultures may indicate dissemination.},

abstract = {VP22 is a structural protein of the herpes simplex virus and has been reported to possess unusual trafficking properties. Here we examined the mechanism of cellular uptake of VP22 using a fusion protein between the C-terminal half of VP22 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Adsorption of VP22-GFP onto a cell surface required heparan sulfate proteoglycans and basic amino acids, in particular, Arg-164 of VP22. Inhibitor treatment, RNA interference, expression of dominant-negative mutant genes, and confocal microscopy all indicated that VP22-GFP enters cells through an endocytic pathway independent of clathrin and caveolae but dependent on dynamin and Arf6 activity. As with CD59 (a lipid raft marker), cell-surface VP22-GFP signals were resistant to Triton X-100 treatment but only partially overlapped cell-surface CD59 signals. Furthermore, unlike other lipid raft-mediated endocytic pathways, no Rho family GTPase was required for VP22-GFP internalization. Internalized VP22 initially entered early endosomes and then moved to lysosomes and possibly recycling endosomes.},

With the emergence of widely applicable techniques for testing gene function, species with sequenced genomes, and multiple tractable species with diverse developmental modes, a phylogenetically broad and molecularly deep understanding of the evolution of DV axis formation in insects is feasible. Here, we review recent progress made in this field, compare our emerging molecular understanding to classical embryological experiments, and suggest future directions of inquiry.},

Electron-microscopic in situ hybridization has been used to show that the ribosomes in this subcellular compartment are eukaryotic. In addition, eukaryotic rRNA has been localised within the nucleus-like organelle, suggesting that the rRNAs may be transcribed from genes in this nucleus. This identification of a second, nucleuscontaining eukaryotic compartment within these cells supports the hypothesis that cryptomonads contain a reduced photosynthetic eukaryotic endosymbiont.},

Glycan microarray analysis of this Viet04 HA reveals an avian alpha2-3 sialic acid receptor binding preference. Introduction of mutations that can convert H1 serotype HAs to human alpha2-6 receptor specificity only enhanced or reduced affinity for avian-type receptors. However, mutations that can convert avian H2 and H3 HAs to human receptor specificity, when inserted onto the Viet04 H5 HA framework, permitted binding to a natural human alpha2-6 glycan, which suggests a path for this H5N1 virus to gain a foothold in the human population.},

abstract = {Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses have been used to examine the relationships among 100 phycobiliprotein sequences. The alignments revealed a number of highly conserved amino acid residues that are involved in chromophore attachment and conformation, alpha-beta interactions and phycobilisome assembly. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the phycobiliprotein subfamilies, previously classified by their biochemical and spectroscopic properties, also formed coherent evolutionary groups. The alpha and beta subunits formed two distinct evolutionary lines that originate from a common ancestor. The pattern of divergence among the alpha subfamilies was identical to that of the beta subfamilies, strongly suggesting that the alpha and beta subunits of each phycobiliprotein type have coevolved. The phylogenetic data support a monophyletic separation of the eukaryotic sequences from the extant cyanobacterial sequences. The eukaryotic phycoerythrins appeared more closely related to the marine Synechococcus phycoerythrins than to the other cyanobacterial phycoerythrins. The cryptophyte phycobiliproteins formed a monophyletic group within the rhodophyte lineage. In conjunction with other phylogenetic markers, the analysis of additional phycobiliprotein sequences may help to further resolve the relationships among phycobiliprotein-containing organisms.},

We sequenced the approximately 120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.},

abstract = {The effects of various stresses on mitochondrial activity and structure within the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii were investigated using the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123. Within control cells, treatment with rhodamine 123 stained an intense fluorescent network, which was considered to be mitochondrial from the similarity in structure to models of mitochondria reconstructed from serial-section electron microscopy, and because this pattern of staining was abolished following the addition of metabolic inhibitors. Following osmotic shrinkage and rehydration, fragmentation of the mitochondrial network was observed within potentially viable cells. This was reversible within 1 h of resuspension in isotonic medium. Exposure of cells to hypertonic solutions of rapidly permeating compounds did not induce similar structural alterations. These changes in the mitochondria were confirmed by thin-section electron microscopy. In the presence of higher osmolalities of non-permeating compounds, which induce a greater loss of viability, rhodamine 123 stained cells uniformly. Following the osmotic stresses induced by slow rates of freezing and subsequent thawing no fragmentation in mitochondrial staining was observed. These findings demonstrate that shrinkage and rehydration may induce alterations to the structure and function of organelles and may be factors in determining cellular viability following osmotic stress.},

abstract = {Clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis have been implicated in the productive entry of many viruses into host cells. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6)-dependent endocytosis is another endocytosis pathway that traffics from the cell surface and it is the only Arf that traffics at the plasma membrane. However, little is known about Arf6-dependent trafficking during virus entry. This study showed that coxsackievirus type B3 (CVB3) associated with decay-accelerating factor in non-polarized HeLa cells can be redirected into non-productive compartments by Arf6-dependent internalization, thus restricting infection. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) Arf6 in HeLa cells resulted in a 2.3- and 3.6-fold decrease in infection, respectively. A dominant-negative inhibitor of Arf6 recovered restriction of infection by WT-Arf6 and CA-Arf6. RNA interference of endogenous Arf6 resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in CVB3 titre in HeLa cells. It was shown that coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) ligation by virus or CAR-specific antibody could activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and lead to Arf6-mediated viral restriction. In the absence of ERK activation, CVB3 internalization into early endosomes was inhibited and subsequent infection was reduced, but Arf6-mediated restriction was also abolished. In conclusion, receptor-mediated signalling enhances CVB3 entry whilst also activating non-productive pathways of virus entry; thus, virus infection is an equilibrium of productive and non-productive pathways of entry.},

Here we employ inkjet-like printing to isolate individual living single human B cells (Raji cell line) and load them directly into standard PCR tubes. Single cells are optically detected in the nozzle of the microfluidic piezoelectric dispenser chip to ensure printing of droplets with single cells only. The printing process has been characterized by using microbeads (10µm diameter) resulting in a single bead delivery in 27 out of 28 cases and relative positional precision of ±350µm at a printing distance of 6mm between nozzle and tube lid. Process-integrated optical imaging enabled to identify the printing failure as void droplet and to exclude it from downstream processing. PCR of truly single-cell DNA was performed without pre-amplification directly from single Raji cells with 33\% success rate (N=197) and Cq values of 36.3±2.5. Additionally single cell whole genome amplification (WGA) was employed to pre-amplify the single-cell DNA by a factor of >1000. This facilitated subsequent PCR for the same gene yielding a success rate of 64\% (N=33) which will allow more sophisticated downstream analysis like sequencing, electrophoresis or multiplexing.},

abstract = {Genomic studies of cell differentiation and function within a whole organism depend on the ability to isolate specific cell types from a tissue, but this is technically difficult. We developed a method called INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) that allows affinity-based isolation of nuclei from individual cell types of a tissue, thereby circumventing the problems associated with mechanical purification techniques. In this method nuclei are affinity-labeled through transgenic expression of a biotinylated nuclear envelope protein in the cell type of interest. Total nuclei are isolated from transgenic plants and biotin-labeled nuclei are then purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, without the need for specialized equipment. INTACT gives high yield and purity of nuclei from the desired cell types, which can be used for genome-wide analysis of gene expression and chromatin features. The entire procedure, from nuclei purification through cDNA preparation or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), can be completed within 2 d. The protocol we present assumes that transgenic lines are already available, and includes procedural details for amplification of cDNA or ChIP DNA prior to microarray or deep sequencing analysis.},

@article{Turck2008,
abstract = {The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is controlled by day length in many plant species. Day length is perceived in leaves and induces a systemic signal, called florigen, that moves through the phloem to the shoot apex. At the shoot apical meristem (SAM), florigen causes changes in gene expression that reprogram the SAM to form flowers instead of leaves. Analysis of flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana placed the CONSTANS/FLOWERING LOCUS T (CO/FT) module at the core of a pathway that promotes flowering in response to changes in day length. We describe progress in defining the molecular mechanisms that activate this module in response to changing day length and the increasing evidence that FT protein is a major component of florigen. Finally, we discuss conservation of FT function in other species and how variation in its regulation could generate different flowering behaviors.},

abstract = {Hematopoiesis and immunity are mediated through complex interactions between multiple cell types and states. This complexity is currently addressed following a reductionist approach of characterizing cell types by a small number of cell surface molecular features and gross functions. While the introduction of global transcriptional profiling technologies enabled a more comprehensive view, heterogeneity within sampled populations remained unaddressed, obscuring the true picture of hematopoiesis and immune system function. A critical mass of technological advances in molecular biology and genomics has enabled genome-wide measurements of single cells - the fundamental unit of immunity. These new advances are expected to boost detection of less frequent cell types and fuzzy intermediate cell states, greatly expanding the resolution of current available classifications. This new era of single-cell genomics in immunology research holds great promise for further understanding of the mechanisms and circuits regulating hematopoiesis and immunity in both health and disease. In the near future, the accuracy of single-cell genomics will ultimately enable precise diagnostics and treatment of multiple hematopoietic and immune related diseases.},

abstract = {The plastid-bearing members of the Cryptophyta contain two functional eukaryotic genomes of different phylogenetic origin, residing in the nucleus and in the nucleomorph, respectively. These widespread and diverse protists thus offer a unique opportunity to study the coevolution of two different eukaryotic genomes within one group of organisms. In this study, the SSU rRNA genes of both genomes were PCR-amplified with specific primers and phylogenetic analyses were performed on different data sets using different evolutionary models. The results show that the composition of the principal clades obtained from the phylogenetic analyses of both genes was largely congruent, but striking differences in evolutionary rates were observed. These affected the topologies of the nuclear and nucleomorph phylogenies differently, resulting in long-branch attraction artifacts when simple evolutionary models were applied. Deletion of long-branch taxa stabilized the internal branching order in both phylogenies and resulted in a completely resolved topology in the nucleomorph phylogeny. A comparison of the tree topologies derived from SSU rDNA sequences with characters previously used in cryptophyte systematics revealed that the biliprotein type was congruent, but the type of inner periplast component incongruent, with the molecular trees. The latter is indicative of a hidden cellular dimorphism (cells with two periplast types present in a single clonal strain) of presumably widespread occurrence throughout cryptophyte diversity, which, in consequence, has far-reaching implications for cryptophyte systematics as it is practiced today.},

abstract = {Trichosporon beigelii is a causative agent of opportunistic infection and summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis in Japan. However, as the diagnosis of Trichosporon beigelii infection is sometimes difficult, the actual incidence of this disease may be underestimated. Of 203 autopsy patients with malignant disease, seven (7.7\%) were diagnosed with disseminated Trichosporon beigelii infection by immunohistochemical investigation of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Including these seven, a total of 43 patients with Trichosporon beigelii infection have been reported in Japan. The majority of them had underlying hematologic malignancies, for which they received cytotoxic chemotherapy resulting in neutropenia. This study indicates that the immunohistochemical method, which can be applied to biopsy specimens, is an excellent tool for specific diagnosis of Trichosporon beigelii infection, which is an emerging fatal mycosis in immunocompromised patients with profound neutropenia.},
