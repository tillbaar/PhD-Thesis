@article{Apweiler1999,
abstract = {The SWISS-PROT protein sequence data bank contains at present nearly 75,000 entries, almost two thirds of which include the potential N-glycosylation consensus sequence, or sequon, NXS/T (where X can be any amino acid but proline) and thus may be glycoproteins. The number of proteins filed as glycoproteins is however considerably smaller, 7942, of which 749 have been characterized with respect to the total number of their carbohydrate units and sites of attachment of the latter to the protein, as well as the nature of the carbohydrate-peptide linking group. Of these well characterized glycoproteins, about 90{\%} carry either N-linked carbohydrate units alone or both N- and O-linked ones, attached at 1297 N-glycosylation sites (1.9 per glycoprotein molecule) and the rest are O-glycosylated only. Since the total number of sequons in the well characterized glycoproteins is 1968, their rate of occupancy is 2/3. Assuming that the same number of N-linked units and rate of sequon occupancy occur in all sequon containing proteins and that the proportion of solely O-glycosylated proteins (ca. 10{\%}) will also be the same as among the well characterized ones, we conclude that the majority of sequon containing proteins will be found to be glycosylated and that more than half of all proteins are glycoproteins.},

abstract = {Hematopoiesis and immunity are mediated through complex interactions between multiple cell types and states. This complexity is currently addressed following a reductionist approach of characterizing cell types by a small number of cell surface molecular features and gross functions. While the introduction of global transcriptional profiling technologies enabled a more comprehensive view, heterogeneity within sampled populations remained unaddressed, obscuring the true picture of hematopoiesis and immune system function. A critical mass of technological advances in molecular biology and genomics has enabled genome-wide measurements of single cells - the fundamental unit of immunity. These new advances are expected to boost detection of less frequent cell types and fuzzy intermediate cell states, greatly expanding the resolution of current available classifications. This new era of single-cell genomics in immunology research holds great promise for further understanding of the mechanisms and circuits regulating hematopoiesis and immunity in both health and disease. In the near future, the accuracy of single-cell genomics will ultimately enable precise diagnostics and treatment of multiple hematopoietic and immune related diseases.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

@article{Quail2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7{\%}. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant detection and accuracy.

RESULTS: Sequence generated by Ion Torrent, MiSeq and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour on GC-rich, neutral and moderately AT-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing the extremely AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the PGM, resulting in no coverage for approximately 30{\%} of the genome. We analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent data compared to MiSeq data, but at the expense of a higher false positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific errors were observed in both PGM and MiSeq data, but not in that from the Pacific Biosciences platform.

CONCLUSIONS: All three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate usable sequence. However there are key differences between the quality of that data and the applications it will support.},

abstract = {The role of RNA polymerase (Pol) III in eukaryotic transcription is commonly thought of as being restricted to a small set of highly expressed, housekeeping non-protein-coding (nc)RNA genes. Recent studies, however, have remarkably expanded the set of known Pol III-synthesized ncRNAs, suggesting that gene-specific Pol III regulation is more common than previously appreciated. Newly identified Pol III transcripts include small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, short interspersed nuclear element-encoded or tRNA-derived RNAs and novel classes of ncRNA that can display significant sequence complementarity to protein-coding genes and might thus regulate their expression. The extent of the Pol III transcriptome, the complexity of its regulation and its influence on cell physiology, development and disease are emerging as new areas for future research. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The purported "black box" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where interpretability is essential. Here we present DeepLlFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLlFT compares the activation of each neuron to its 'reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLlFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLlFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

@article{Buness2007,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In cancer, chromosomal imbalances like amplifications and deletions, or changes in epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation influence the transcriptional activity. These alterations are often not limited to a single gene but affect several genes of the genomic region and may be relevant for the disease status. For example, the ERBB2 amplicon (17q21) in breast cancer is associated with poor patient prognosis. We present a general, unsupervised method for genome-wide gene expression data to systematically detect tumor patients with chromosomal regions of distinct transcriptional activity. The method aims to find expression patterns of adjacent genes with a consistently decreased or increased level of gene expression in tumor samples. Such patterns have been found to be associated with chromosomal aberrations and clinical parameters like tumor grading and thus can be useful for risk stratification or therapy. RESULTS: Our approach was applied to 12 independent human breast cancer microarray studies comprising 1422 tumor samples. We prioritized chromosomal regions and genes predominantly found across all studies. The result highlighted not only regions which are well known to be amplified like 17q21 and 11q13, but also others like 8q24 (distal to MYC) and 17q24-q25 which may harbor novel putative oncogenes. Since our approach can be applied to any microarray study it may become a valuable tool for the exploration of transcriptional changes in diverse disease types. AVAILABILITY: The R source codes which implement the method and an exemplary analysis are available at http://www.dkfz.de/mga2/people/buness/CTP/.

abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Chromatin remodeling is important for the epigenetic reprogramming of human primordial germ cells. However, the comprehensive chromatin state has not yet been analyzed for human fetal germ cells (FGCs). Here we use nucleosome occupancy and methylation sequencing method to analyze both the genome-wide chromatin accessibility and DNA methylome at a series of crucial time points during fetal germ cell development in both human and mouse. We find 116 887 and 137 557 nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) in human and mouse FGCs, covering a large set of germline-specific and highly dynamic regulatory genomic elements, such as enhancers. Moreover, we find that the distal NDRs are enriched specifically for binding motifs of the pluripotency and germ cell master regulators such as NANOG, SOX17, AP2$\gamma$ and OCT4 in human FGCs, indicating the existence of a delicate regulatory balance between pluripotency-related genes and germ cell-specific genes in human FGCs, and the functional significance of these genes for germ cell development in vivo. Our work offers a comprehensive and high-resolution roadmap for dissecting chromatin state transition dynamics during the epigenomic reprogramming of human and mouse FGCs.},

Multidrug resistance in bacteria may be generated by one of two mechanisms. First, these bacteria may accumulate multiple genes, each coding for resistance to a single drug, within a single cell. This accumulation occurs typically on resistance (R) plasmids. Second, multidrug resistance may also occur by the increased expression of genes that code for multidrug efflux pumps, extruding a wide range of drugs. This review discusses our current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in both types of resistance.},

abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or ``mutation signatures{\&}{\#}039;{\&}{\#}039; at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5{\&}{\#}039; to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with ``mixed-membership models{\&}{\#}039;{\&}{\#}039; which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature{\_}shiny/.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

abstract = {Background: Given the demonstrated utility of Third Generation Sequencing [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] long reads in many studies, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their data quality and applications is in high demand. Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of PacBio, ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.},

More than 70{\%} of these residues are present in the 3′-most (last) exons, with a very sharp rise (sixfold) within 150–400 nucleotides of the start of the last exon. Two-thirds of last exon m6A and {\textgreater}40{\%} of all m6A in mRNA are present in 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs); contrary to earlier suggestions, there is no preference for location of m6A sites around stop codons. Moreover, m6A is significantly higher in noncoding last exons than in next-to-last exons harboring stop codons. We found that m6A density peaks early in the 3′ UTR and that, among transcripts with alternative polyA (APA) usage in both the brain and the liver, brain transcripts preferentially use distal polyA sites, as reported, and also show higher proximal m6A density in the last exons. Furthermore, when we reduced m6A methylation by knocking down components of the methylase complex and then examined 661 transcripts with proximal m6A peaks in last exons, we identified a set of 111 transcripts with altered (approximately two-thirds increased proximal) APA use. Taken together, these observations suggest a role of m6A modification in regulating proximal alternative polyA choice.},

abstract = {Aims: The advent of specific ALK-targeting drugs has radically changed the outcome of patients with ALK translocated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, emerging resistance to treatment with ALK inhibitors in these patients remains a major concern. In previous studies, we analysed two ALK+ patient cohorts (TP53 wild-type/TP53 mutated) in terms of copy number alterations. All patients belonging to the TP53 wild-type group had mainly genetically stable genomes, with one exception showing chromosomal instability and amplifications of several gene loci, including TERT. Here, we aimed to determine the prevalence of TERT amplifications in these ALK+ lung cancer patients by analysing an independent cohort of 109 ALK translocated cases. We further analysed the copy numbers of numerous cancer-relevant genes and other genetic aberrations. Methods and results: The prevalence of TERT amplifications was determined by means of FISH analyses. Copy numbers of 87 cancer-relevant genes were determined by NanoString nCounter{\textregistered} technology, FoundationOne{\textregistered} and lung-specific NGS panels in some of these TERT-amplified samples, and clinical data on patients with TERT-amplified tumours were collected. Our data revealed that five (4.6{\%}) of all 109 analysed ALK+ patients harboured amplification of TERT and that these patients had genetically unstable genomes. Conclusions: Our preliminary study shows that ALK+ adenocarcinomas should be evaluated in the context of their genomic background in order to more clearly understand and predict patients' individual course of disease.},

abstract = {Gene transcription can be activated by decreasing the duration of RNA polymerase II pausing in the promoter-proximal region, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we use a ‘multi-omics' approach to demonstrate that the duration of polymerase pausing generally limits the productive frequency of transcription initiation in human cells (‘pause-initiation limit'). We further engineer a human cell line to allow for specific and rapid inhibition of the P-TEFb kinase CDK9, which is implicated in polymerase pause release. CDK9 activity decreases the pause duration but also increases the productive initiation frequency. This shows that CDK9 stimulates release of paused polymerase and activates transcription by increasing the number of transcribing polymerases and thus the amount of mRNA synthesized per time. CDK9 activity is also associated with long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that enhancers can influence the pause-initiation limit to regulate transcription.},

Genomic alterations in squamous cell lung cancers have not been comprehensively characterized, and no molecularly targeted agents have been specifically developed for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, here we profile 178 lung squamous cell carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens.

abstract = {Aquatic environments like peat bogs are affected by anthropogenic metal input into the environment. These ecosystems are inhabited by unicellular green algae of the class Zygnematophyceae. In this study the desmid Micrasterias denticulata was stressed with 600 nM Cd, 10 $\mu$M Cr and 300 nM Cu for 3 weeks. GSH levels were measured with HPLC and did not differ between the different treatments or the control. According to the metallo-thiolomics concept, mass spectrometry was used as a method for unambiguous thiol peptide identification. PC2, PC3 and PC4 were clearly identified in the Cd stressed sample with UPLC-MS by their MS spectrum and molecular masses. PC2 and PC3 were determined to be the main thiol compounds, while PC4 was only abundant in traces in Micrasterias. In addition, the identity of PC2 and PC3 was confirmed by MS/MS. No PCs were detected in the Cu stressed algae sample. However, in the Cr stressed sample traces of PC2 were indicated by a peak in UPLC-MS at the retention time of the PC2 standard, but the intensity was too low to acquire reliable MS and MS/MS spectra. In this study PCs have been detected for the first time in a green alga of the division Streptophyta, a close relative to higher plants.},

We developed transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq), a protocol that uniformly maps the entire range of RNA-producing units and estimates rates of RNA synthesis and degradation. Application of TT-seq to human K562 cells recovers stable messenger RNAs and long intergenic noncoding RNAs and additionally maps transient enhancer, antisense, and promoter-associated RNAs. TT-seq analysis shows that enhancer RNAs are short-lived and lack U1 motifs and secondary structure. TT-seq also maps transient RNA downstream of polyadenylation sites and uncovers sites of transcription termination; we found, on average, four transcription termination sites, distributed in a window with a median width of {\~{}}3300 base pairs. Termination sites coincide with a DNA motif associated with pausing of RNA polymerase before its release from the genome.},

Previously, it has been shown that the $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) nanopore contains three recognition sites, capable of discriminating between individual DNA bases when oligonucleotides are immobilized within the nanopore. However, the direct sequencing of RNA is also of critical importance. Here, we achieve sharply defined current distributions that enable clear discrimination of the four nucleobases, guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil, in RNA. Further, the modified bases, inosine, N(6)-methyladenosine, and N(5)-methylcytosine, can be distinguished.},

abstract = {Alu elements have amplified in primate genomes through a RNA-dependent mechanism, termed retroposition, and have reached a copy number in excess of 500,000 copies per human genome. These elements have been proposed to have a number of functions in the human genome, and have certainly had a major impact on genomic architecture. Alu elements continue to amplify at a rate of about one insertion every 200 new births. We have found 16 examples of diseases caused by the insertion of Alu elements, suggesting that they may contribute to about 0.1{\%} of human genetic disorders by this mechanism. The large number of Alu elements within primate genomes also provides abundant opportunities for unequal homologous recombination events. These events often occur intrachromosomally, resulting in deletion or duplication of exons in a gene, but they also can occur interchromosomally, causing more complex chromosomal abnormalities. We have found 33 cases of germline genetic diseases and 16 cases of cancer caused by unequal homologous recombination between Alu repeats. We estimate that this mode of mutagenesis accounts for another 0.3{\%} of human genetic diseases. Between these different mechanisms, Alu elements have not only contributed a great deal to the evolution of the genome but also continue to contribute to a significant portion of human genetic diseases.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved RNA silencing pathway that leads to sequence-specific mRNA decay in response to the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Long dsRNA molecules are first processed by Dicer into 21-22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The siRNAs are incorporated into a multimeric RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that cleaves mRNAs at a site determined by complementarity with the siRNAs. Following this initial endonucleolytic cleavage, the mRNA is degraded by a mechanism that is not completely understood. We investigated the decay pathway of mRNAs targeted by RISC in Drosophila cells. We show that 5′ mRNA fragments generated by RISC cleavage are rapidly degraded from their 3′ ends by the exosome, whereas the 3′ fragments are degraded from their 5′ ends by XRN1. Exosome-mediated decay of the 5′ fragments requires the Drosophila homologs of yeast Ski2p, Ski3p, and Ski8p, suggesting that their role as regulators of exosome activity is conserved. Our findings indicate that mRNAs targeted by siRNAs are degraded from the ends generated by RISC cleavage, without undergoing decapping or deadenylation.

abstract = {The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Data Coordinating Center has developed the ENCODE Portal database and website as the source for the data and metadata generated by the ENCODE Consortium. Two principles have motivated the design. First, experimental protocols, analytical procedures and the data themselves should be made publicly accessible through a coherent, web-based search and download interface. Second, the same interface should serve carefully curated metadata that record the provenance of the data and justify its interpretation in biological terms. Since its initial release in 2013 and in response to recommendations from consortium members and the wider community of scientists who use the Portal to access ENCODE data, the Portal has been regularly updated to better reflect these design principles. Here we report on these updates, including results from new experiments, uniformly-processed data from other projects, new visualization tools and more comprehensive metadata to describe experiments and analyses. Additionally, the Portal is now home to meta(data) from related projects including Genomics of Gene Regulation, Roadmap Epigenome Project, Model organism ENCODE (modENCODE) and modERN. The Portal now makes available over 13000 datasets and their accompanying metadata and can be accessed at: https://www.encodeproject.org/.},

abstract = {The core components of the nuclear RNA export pathway are thought to be required for export of virtually all polyadenylated RNAs. Here, we depleted different proteins that act in nuclear export in human cells and quantified the transcriptome-wide consequences on RNA localization. Different genes exhibited substantially variable sensitivities, with depletion of NXF1 and TREX components causing some transcripts to become strongly retained in the nucleus while others were not affected. Specifically, NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U content, whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts. Using massively parallel reporter assays, we identified short sequence elements that render transcripts dependent on NXF1 for their export and identified synergistic effects of splicing and NXF1. These results revise the current model of how nuclear export shapes the distribution of RNA within human cells.},

Non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons including LINE-1, Alu and SVA elements have proliferated over the past 80 million years of primate evolution and now account for approximately one-third of the human genome. In this Review, we focus on this major class of elements and discuss the many ways that they affect the human genome: from generating insertion mutations and genomic instability to altering gene expression and contributing to genetic innovation. Increasingly detailed analyses of human and other primate genomes are revealing the scale and complexity of the past and current contributions of non-LTR retrotransposons to genomic change in the human lineage. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This compartment, which is partitioned off from the main cytoplasm by two membranes, contains a chloroplast and a small nucleus-like organelle surrounded by ribosomelike particles. Electron-microscopic in situ hybridization has been used to show that the ribosomes in this subcellular compartment are eukaryotic. In addition, eukaryotic rRNA has been localised within the nucleus-like organelle, suggesting that the rRNAs may be transcribed from genes in this nucleus. This identification of a second, nucleuscontaining eukaryotic compartment within these cells supports the hypothesis that cryptomonads contain a reduced photosynthetic eukaryotic endosymbiont.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations arise and accumulate both during tumor genesis and progression. However, the order in which mutations occur is an open question and the inference of the temporal ordering at the gene level could potentially impact on patient treatment. Thus, exploiting recent observations suggesting that the occurrence of mutations is a non-memoryless process, we developed a computational approach to infer timed oncogenetic directed acyclic graphs (TO-DAGs) from human tumor mutation data. Such graphs represent the path and the waiting times of alterations during tumor evolution. The probability of occurrence of each alteration in a path is the probability that the alteration occurs when all alterations prior to it have occurred. The waiting time between an alteration and the subsequent is modelled as a stochastic function of the conditional probability of the event given the occurrence of the previous one. TO-DAG performances have been evaluated both on synthetic data and on somatic non-silent mutations from prostate cancer and melanoma patients and then compared with those of current well-established approaches. TO-DAG shows high performance scores on synthetic data and recognizes mutations in gatekeeper tumor suppressor genes as trigger for several downstream mutational events in the human tumor data.},

abstract = {One of the major steps in the evolution of life was the origin of photosynthesis in nucleated cells underpinning the evolution of plants. It is well accepted that this evolutionary process was initiated when a photosynthetic bacterium (a cyanobacterium) was taken up by a colorless host cell, probably more than a billion years ago, and transformed into a photosynthetic organelle (a plastid) during a process known as primary endosymbiosis. Here, we use sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of the prokaryotic rDNA operon to show that the thecate, filose amoeba Paulinella chromatophora Lauterborn obtained its photosynthetic organelles by a similar but more recent process, which involved a different cyanobacterium, indicating that the evolution of photosynthetic organelles from cyanobacteria was not a unique event, as is commonly believed, but may be an ongoing process.},

They have gained considerable importance in the recent times with evidence of their involvement in various aspects of gene regulation, e.g. alternative splicing, nucleosome positioning, CpG methylation, binding sites for transcription factors and hormone receptors, etc. The objective of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the distribution of Alu repeat elements in the human genome. Such analysis is expected to yield insights into various aspects of gene regulation in primates. RESULTS: Analysis of Alu repeat distribution for the human genome build 32 (released in January 2003) reveals that they occupy nearly one-tenth portion of the sequenced regions. Huge variations in Alu frequencies were seen across the genome with chromosome 19 being the most and chromosome Y being the least Alu dense chromosomes. The highlights of the analysis are as follows: (1). three-fourth of the total genes in the genome are associated with Alus. (2). Alu density is higher in genes as compared with intergenic regions in all the chromosomes except 19 and 22. (3). Alu density in human genome is highly correlated with GC content, gene density and intron density with GC content being major deterministic factor compared with other two. (4). Alu densities were correlated more with gene density than intron density indicating the insertion of Alus in untranslated regions of exons.},

Given a single case-control experiment, it uses a linear regression model to assess whether the common targets of two arbitrary TFs behave differently than expected from the genes targeted by only one of the TFs. When applied to osmotic stress data in S. cerevisiae, OHC produces consistent results across three types of expression measurements: gene expression microarray data, RNA Polymerase II ChIP-chip binding data and messenger RNA synthesis rates. Among the eight novel, condition-specific TF pairs, we validate the interaction between Gcn4p and Arr1p experimentally. We apply OHC to a large gene activity dataset in S. cerevisiae and provide a compendium of condition-specific TF interactions.},

abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

A portion of Alu elements is transcribed by RNA Pol III, whereas the remaining ones are part of Pol II transcripts. Because Alu elements are highly repetitive, it has been difficult to identify the Pol III–transcribed elements and quantify their expression levels. In this study, we generated high-resolution, long-genomic-span RAMPAGE data in 155 biosamples all with matching RNA-seq data and built an atlas of 17,249 Pol III–transcribed Alu elements. We further performed an integrative analysis on the ChIP-seq data of 10 histone marks and hundreds of transcription factors, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, ChIA-PET data, and functional data in several biosamples, and our results revealed that although the human-specific Alu elements are transcriptionally repressed, the older, expressed Alu elements may be exapted by the human host to function as cell-type–specific enhancers for their nearby protein-coding genes.},

The interpretation of these data requires unbiased, efficient statistical methods that model the dynamics of cell phenotypes. Results: We introduce treeHFM, a probabilistic model which generalizes the theory of hidden Markov models to tree structured data. While accounting for the entire genealogy of a cell, treeHFM categorizes cells according to their primary phenotypic features. It models all relevant events in a cell's life, including cell division, and thereby enables the analysis of event order and cell fate heterogeneity. Simulations show higher accuracy in predicting correct state labels when modeling the more complex, tree-shaped dependency of samples over standard HMM modeling. Applying treeHFM to time lapse images of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, we demonstrate that progenitor cells undergo a well-ordered sequence of differentiation events.},

The performances of the four methods are compared using Average Mean Square Errors (AMSE) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The result shows that PCR has the lowest AMSE among other methods. It indicates that PCR is the most accurate regression coefficients estimator in each sample size and various levels of explanatory variables studied. PCR also performs as the best estimation model since it gives the lowest AIC values compare to OLS, RR, and LASSO.},

Mutations in AQP2 lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disorder in which functional AQP2 is not expressed on the apical cell surface of kidney collecting duct principal cells. The mechanisms and pathways directing AQP2 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex and beyond have not been defined. We found that approximately 25{\%} of newly synthesized AQP2 is glycosylated. Nonglycosylated and complex-glycosylated wild-type AQP2 are stable proteins with a half-life of 6-12 h and are both detectable on the cell surface. We show that AQP2 forms tetramers in the endoplasmic reticulum during or very early after synthesis and reaches the Golgi complex in 1-1.5 h. We also report that glycosylation is neither essential for tetramerization nor for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Instead, the N-linked glycan is important for exit from the Golgi complex and sorting of AQP2 to the plasma membrane. These results are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the intracellular retention of AQP2 in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.},

Recent evidence suggests that regulation of RBPs that modulate both RNA stability and translation may have a profound effect on the proteome. However, regulation of RBPs in clinically relevant experimental conditions has not been studied systematically. Methods We used RNA interactome capture, a method for the global identification of RBPs to characterize the global RNA‐binding proteome (RBPome) associated with polyA-tailed RNA species in murine ciliated epithelial cells of the inner medullary collecting duct. To study regulation of RBPs in a clinically relevant condition, we analyzed hypoxia-associated changes of the RBPome. Results We identified .1000 RBPs that had been previously found using other systems. In addition, we found a number of novel RBPs not identified by previous screens using mouse or human cells, suggesting that these proteins may be specific RBPs in differentiated kidney epithelial cells. We also found quantitative differences in RBP-binding to mRNA that were associated with hypoxia versus normoxia. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the regulation of RBPs through environmental stimuli and provide insight into the biology of hypoxia-response signaling in epithelial cells in the kidney. A repository of the RBPome and proteome in kidney tubular epithelial cells, derived from our findings, is freely accessible online, and may contribute to a better understanding of the role of RNA-protein interactions in kidney tubular epithelial cells, including the response of these cells to hypoxia.},

abstract = {The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is both an invaluable model organism for plant biology and an attractive biotechnological production system. Despite the availability of efficient methods for introduction of foreign genes into the nuclear genome of the alga, transgene expression levels are usually very poor. This is a serious limitation that has severely hampered both post-genomics research in Chlamydomonas and use of the alga in molecular farming. Here we report a solution to this problem. We have designed a genetic screen that facilitates isolation of algal strains that efficiently express introduced transgenes. The levels of accumulation of foreign protein in our expression strains are almost uniformly high in all transgenic clones and are little influenced by position effects. The possibility of expressing transgenes to high levels will greatly facilitate post-genomics research in Chlamydomonas, and will also boost exploitation of the alga as an inexpensive production host for biopharmaceuticals and other valuable compounds.},

abstract = {Motivation: The highly portable Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer has enabled new applications of genome sequencing directly in the field. However, the MinION currently relies on a cloud computing platform, Metrichor (metrichor.com), for translating locally generated sequencing data into basecalls. Results: To allow offline and private analysis of MinION data, we created Nanocall. Nanocall is the first freely-available, open-source basecaller for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data and does not require an internet connection. On two ecoli and two human samples, with natural as well as PCR-amplified DNA, Nanocall reads have {\~{}}68{\%} identity, directly comparable to Metrichor "1D" data. Further, Nanocall is efficient, processing {\~{}}500Kbp of sequence per core hour, and fully parallelized. Using 8 cores, Nanocall could basecall a MinION sequencing run in real time. Metrichor provides the ability to integrate the "1D" sequencing of template and complement strands of a single DNA molecule, and create a "2D" read. Nanocall does not currently integrate this technology, and addition of this capability will be an important future development. In summary, Nanocall is the first open-source, freely available, off-line basecaller for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. Availability: Nanocall is available at github.com/mateidavid/nanocall, released under the MIT license. Contact: matei.david at oicr.on.ca},

This view has changed dramatically in the recent years, to a large extent as a result of systematic efforts to map and quantify various RNA modifications in a transcriptome-wide manner, revealing that RNA modifications are reversible, dynamically regulated, far more widespread than originally thought, and involved in major biological processes, including cell differentiation, sex determination and stress responses. Here we summarize the state of knowledge and provide a catalogue of RNA modifications and their links to neurological disorders, cancers and other diseases. With the advent of direct RNA sequencing technologies, we expect that this catalogue will help prioritize those RNA modifications for transcriptome-wide maps.},

This study investigates the mappability of transposable elements with 50 bp, 76 bp and 100 bp paired-end read libraries. With respect to those read lengths and allowing for 3 mismatches during alignment, over 68, 85, and 88{\%} of all transposable elements in the RepeatMasker database are uniquely mappable, suggesting that accurate locus-specific mapping of older transposable elements is well within reach.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs have emerged as essential regulators of gene expression and may play important roles in a variety of human disorders. To understand the role of microRNA-mediated gene regulation in the kidney, we deleted the microRNA-processing enzyme Dicer in developing renal tubules and parts of the ureteric bud in mice. Genetic deletion of Dicer resulted in renal failure and death of the animals at 4-6 weeks of age. Interestingly, the kidneys of microRNA-deficient animals were small due to a reduced number of nephrons and showed massive hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction. This phenotype is reminiscent of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), an important group of human disorders characterized by a combination of renal hypoplasia with congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract. We used metanephric kidney cultures to examine the developmental defects underlying these pathologies. Dicer knockout kidneys showed a significant reduction of tubular branching explaining renal hypoplasia. Moreover, the ureters of these kidneys showed an altered morphology and impaired motility. These functional changes went along with altered expression of smooth muscle actin implying a defect in the differentiation of ureteric smooth muscle cells. In addition, we show the polycystic kidney disease gene Pkd1 to be a target of miR-20 implying that this interaction may contribute to the molecular basis for the cystogenesis in our model. In conclusion, these data demonstrate an essential role for microRNA-dependent gene regulation in mammalian kidney development and suggest that deregulation of microRNAs may underlie CAKUT, the most important group of renal disorders in humans.},

The disease is usually asymptomatic, benign bone dysplasia; it does not affect the quality of life of the patient and requires no special treatment.

The clinical case of osteopoikilosis, genetically determined, in the stage of spreading of lesions in woman (31 yr.) is presented. The disease was suspected in the prophylactic fluorography, revealed some focal changes in the proximal epiphysis of the humerus. Radiographs of hands, hip and shoulder joints are found clearly delineated focal bone compactions (up to 0,8 cm). The foci were located in the epiphysis, metaphysis and apophyses of long and short tubular bones and cancellous bone of the pelvis and wrists, their number ranged from 2 to 60. Subjective and objective clinical examination of pathological changes of the skeleton did not reveal.

The generation of the translation is modelled with a target Recurrent Language Model, whereas the conditioning on the source sentence is modelled with a Convolutional Sentence Model. Through various experiments, we show first that our models obtain a perplexity with respect to gold translations that is {\textgreater} 43{\%} lower than that of state-of-the-art alignment-based translation models. Secondly, we show that they are remarkably sensitive to the word order, syntax, and mean- ing of the source sentence despite lacking alignments.

Over the last years, several lines of evidence demonstrated that these elements modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in at least three independent manners. They have been shown to be involved in alternative splicing, RNA editing and translation regulation. These findings highlight how the genome adapted to these repetitive elements by assigning them important functions in regulation of gene expression. Alu elements should therefore be considered as a large reservoir of potential regulatory functions that have been actively participating in primate evolution.},

abstract = {The outcome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection depends upon the interplay of both host and viral factors. During lytic infection, HSV-1 causes a loss of immunofluorescent staining of discrete nuclear domains (ND10). This elimination of the host's ND10 staining occurs under conditions that allow only HSV-1 immediate early viral gene expression. Western blot analysis indicates that the loss of ND10 staining is due to ND10 redistribution, rather than protein degradation or turnover. When deletion mutants of all of the HSV-1 immediate early genes were tested, only infection with an immediate early gene 1 product (ICP0) deletion mutant, d11403, was unable to eliminate ND10 antigen staining. Also, ICP0 transiently colocalized with ND10 antigens, after which ND10 antigens became undetectable. At late times during infection with d11403, the host ND10 antigens were retained in virus-induced structures which were never observed during wild-type HSV-1 infection. These results suggested that ICP0 may be directly involved in the modification of the host nuclear domain. Infection with an adenovirus recombinant that expressed ICP0 demonstrated that in the absence of other HSV-1 proteins ICP0 was sufficient for the change in nuclear distribution of host antigens located at ND10. We postulate that the trans-activation function of ICP0 during viral replication may be mediated by replacing, modifying or reorganizing nuclear host factors.},

abstract = {Alus, primate-specific retroelements, are the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome. They are composed of two related but distinct monomers, left and right arms. Intronic Alu elements may acquire mutations that generate functional splice sites, a process called exonization. Most exonizations occur in right arms of antisense Alu elements, and are alternatively spliced. Here we show that without the left arm, exonization of the right arm shifts from alternative to constitutive splicing. This eliminates the evolutionary conserved isoform and may thus be selected against. We further show that insertion of the left arm downstream of a constitutively spliced non-Alu exon shifts splicing from constitutive to alternative. Although the two arms are highly similar, the left arm is characterized by weaker splicing signals and lower exonic splicing regulatory (ESR) densities. Mutations that improve these potential splice signals activate exonization and shift splicing from the right to the left arm. Collaboration between two or more putative splice signals renders the intronic left arm with a pseudo-exon function. Thus, the dimeric form of the Alu element fortuitously provides it with an evolutionary advantage, allowing enrichment of the primate transcriptome without compromising its original repertoire.},

abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although AKI lacks effective therapeutic approaches, preventive strategies using preconditioning protocols, including caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, have been shown to prevent injury in animal models. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the enhanced resistance to AKI conferred by such approaches is needed to facilitate clinical use. We hypothesized that these preconditioning strategies use similar pathways to augment cellular stress resistance. METHODS To identify genes and pathways shared by caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, we used RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling to compare the transcriptional response with both modes of preconditioning in mice before and after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. RESULTS The gene expression signatures induced by both preconditioning strategies involve distinct common genes and pathways that overlap significantly with the transcriptional changes observed after ischemia-reperfusion injury. These changes primarily affect oxidation-reduction processes and have a major effect on mitochondrial processes. We found that 16 of the genes differentially regulated by both modes of preconditioning were strongly correlated with clinical outcome; most of these genes had not previously been directly linked to AKI. CONCLUSIONS This comparative analysis of the gene expression signatures in preconditioning strategies shows overlapping patterns in caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, pointing toward common molecular mechanisms. Our analysis identified a limited set of target genes not previously known to be associated with AKI; further study of their potential to provide the basis for novel preventive strategies is warranted. To allow for optimal interactive usability of the data by the kidney research community, we provide an online interface for user-defined interrogation of the gene expression datasets (http://shiny.cecad.uni-koeln.de:3838/IRaP/).},

abstract = {Post-transcriptional modification of RNA nucleosides occurs in all living organisms. Pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding RNAs, enhances the function of transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA by stabilizing the RNA structure. Messenger RNAs were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mRNA function--it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre. However, without evidence of naturally occurring mRNA pseudouridylation, its physiological relevance was unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudouridylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human RNAs using Pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution method for pseudouridine identification. Pseudo-seq accurately identifies known modification sites as well as many novel sites in non-coding RNAs, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated sites in mRNAs. Genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine synthases, Pus1-4, 6, 7 and 9. Notably, the majority of pseudouridines in mRNA are regulated in response to environmental signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum starvation in human cells. These results suggest a mechanism for the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through inducible mRNA modifications. Our findings reveal unanticipated roles for pseudouridylation and provide a resource for identifying the targets of pseudouridine synthases implicated in human disease.},

abstract = {Objective: To establish evidence-based recommendations for the molecular analysis of lung cancers that are required to guide EGFR- and ALK-directed therapies, addressing which patients and samples should be tested, and when and how testing should be performed. Participants: Three cochairs without conflicts of interest were selected, one from each of the 3 sponsoring professional societies: College of American Pathologists, International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and Association for Molecular Pathology. Writing and advisory panels were constituted from additional experts from these societies. Evidence: Three unbiased literature searches of electronic databases were performed to capture published articles from January 2004 through February 2012, yielding 1533 articles whose abstracts were screened to identify 521 pertinent articles that were then reviewed in detail for their relevance to the recommendations. Evidence was formally graded for each recommendation. Consensus Process: Initial recommendations were formulated by the cochairs and panel members at a public meeting. Each guideline section was assigned to at least 2 panelists. Drafts were circulated to the writing panel (version 1), advisory panel (version 2), and the public (version 3) before submission (version 4). Conclusions: The 37 guideline items address 14 subjects, including 15 recommendations (evidence grade A/B). The major recommendations are to use testing for EGFR mutations and ALK fusions to guide patient selection for therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, respectively, in all patients with advanced-stage adenocarcinoma, regardless of sex, race, smoking history, or other clinical risk factors, and to prioritize EGFR and ALK testing over other molecular predictive tests. As scientific discoveries and clinical practice outpace the completion of randomized clinical trials, evidence-based guidelines developed by expert practitioners are vital for communicating emerging clinical standards. Already, new treatments targeting genetic alterations in other, less common driver oncogenes are being evaluated in lung cancer, and testing for these may be addressed in future versions of these guidelines.},

abstract = {mRNA is thought to predominantly reside in the cytoplasm, where it is translated and eventually degraded. Although nuclear retention of mRNA has a regulatory potential, it is considered extremely rare in mammals. Here, to explore the extent of mRNA retention in metabolic tissues, we combine deep sequencing of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions with single-molecule transcript imaging in mouse beta cells, liver, and gut. We identify a wide range of protein-coding genes for which the levels of spliced polyadenylated mRNA are higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. These include genes such as the transcription factor ChREBP, Nlrp6, Glucokinase, and Glucagon receptor. We demonstrate that nuclear retention of mRNA can efficiently buffer cytoplasmic transcript levels from noise that emanates from transcriptional bursts. Our study challenges the view that transcripts predominantly reside in the cytoplasm and reveals a role of the nucleus in dampening gene expression noise. Bahar Halpern et al. combine whole-transcriptome and single-molecule approaches to demonstrate that a substantial fraction of genes have higher levels of spliced, polyadenylated mRNA in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm in mammalian tissues. This nuclear retention reduces cytoplasmic gene expression noise created by transcriptional bursts.},

The protein complex involved in the pre-mRNA polyadenylation is coupled with RNA polymerase II during the transcription of a gene. According to the commonly accepted view, only RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase II can be polyadenylated in an AAUAAA-dependent manner. Here we report the polyadenylation of short interspersed elements (SINEs) B2 and VES transcripts generated by RNA polymerase III. HeLa cells were transfected with SINE constructs with or without polyadenylation signals. The analyses of the SINE transcripts showed that only the RNAs with the AAUAAA-signal contained poly(A) tails. Polyadenylated B2 RNA was found to be much more stable in cells than B2 RNA without a poly(A) tail.},

abstract = {The terminal part of the inner medullary collecting duct exhibits a high degree of water permeability that is independent of increased intracellular cAMP and not accounted for by the activity of the known renal epithelial water channels CHIP28 (28-kDa channel-forming integral protein) and WCH-CD (collecting duct water channel protein). Starting with rat kidney papilla mRNA, reverse transcription PCR was performed with degenerate primers assuming that the putative channel would be a member of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family of proteins. A cDNA fragment was identified and used to screen a rat kidney cDNA library. A 1.9-kb cDNA clone was isolated. The open reading frame of 876 bp coded for a protein of 292 amino acids (M(r), 31,431). Aquaporin 3 (AQP3; 31.4-kDa water channel protein) is a newly discovered member of the MIP family. Northern blot analysis showed a single transcript for AQP3 of approximately 1.9 kb present in the renal medulla, predominantly in the inner medulla. With in situ hybridization, abundant message was found in the cells of the medullary collecting ducts. Injection of the complementary RNA of AQP3 into Xenopus oocytes markedly increased the osmotic water permeability. This permeability had an energy of activation of 3.0 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J), it was fully blocked by 1 mM p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, and this inhibition was reversed by 5 mM dithiothreitol. cAMP did not increase this water permeability. AQP3 did not permit passage of monovalent ions (Na, K, Cl); however, it is slightly permeable to urea. The present study demonstrates the existence of an additional water channel, AQP3, in epithelial cells of the medullary collecting duct.},

abstract = {Clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis have been implicated in the productive entry of many viruses into host cells. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6)-dependent endocytosis is another endocytosis pathway that traffics from the cell surface and it is the only Arf that traffics at the plasma membrane. However, little is known about Arf6-dependent trafficking during virus entry. This study showed that coxsackievirus type B3 (CVB3) associated with decay-accelerating factor in non-polarized HeLa cells can be redirected into non-productive compartments by Arf6-dependent internalization, thus restricting infection. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) Arf6 in HeLa cells resulted in a 2.3- and 3.6-fold decrease in infection, respectively. A dominant-negative inhibitor of Arf6 recovered restriction of infection by WT-Arf6 and CA-Arf6. RNA interference of endogenous Arf6 resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in CVB3 titre in HeLa cells. It was shown that coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) ligation by virus or CAR-specific antibody could activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and lead to Arf6-mediated viral restriction. In the absence of ERK activation, CVB3 internalization into early endosomes was inhibited and subsequent infection was reduced, but Arf6-mediated restriction was also abolished. In conclusion, receptor-mediated signalling enhances CVB3 entry whilst also activating non-productive pathways of virus entry; thus, virus infection is an equilibrium of productive and non-productive pathways of entry.},

abstract = {Fatty acids represent an important energy source for preimplantation embryos. Fatty acids oxidation is correlated with the embryo oxygen consumption which remains relatively constant up to the 8-cell stage, but suddenly increases between the 8-cell and morula stages. The degradation of fatty acids occurs in mitochondria and is catalyzed by several carnitine acyl transferases, including two carnitine palmitoyl transferases, CPT-I and CPT-II. We have carried out a study to determine the relative number of transcripts of Cpt1b and Cpt2 genes encoding for m-CPT-I and CPT-II enzymes, during mouse preimplantation development. Here we show that Cpt1b transcripts are first and temporally detected at the 2-cell stage and reappear at the morula and blastocyst stage. Cpt2 transcripts decrease following fertilization to undetectable levels and are present again later at the morula stage. These results show that transcription of both Cpt1b and Cpt2 is triggered at the morula stage, concomitantly with known increasing profiles of oxygen uptake and fatty acids oxidation. Based on the number of Cpt2 transcripts detected, we could discriminate the presence of two groups of embryos with high and low number of transcripts, from the zygote throughout preimplantation development. To further investigate if the establishment of these two groups of embryos occurs prior to fertilization, we have analyzed the relative number of transcripts of both genes in antral and ovulated MII oocytes. As for preimplantation embryos, MII oocytes show two groups of Cpt2 expression. Antral oocytes, classified according to their chromatin configuration in SN (surrounded nucleolus, in which the nucleolus is surrounded by a rim of Hoechst-positive chromatin) and NSN (not surrounded nucleolus, in which this rim is absent), show three groups with different numbers of Cpt2 transcripts. All NSN oocytes have a number of Cpt2 transcripts doubled compared to that of the group of MII oocytes with high expression. Instead, SN oocytes could be singled out into two groups with high and low numbers of Cpt2 transcripts, similar to those found in MII oocytes. The results of this study point out a correlation between the timing of fatty acids oxidation during preimplantation development and the expression of two genes encoding two enzymes involved in the oxidative pathway. Furthermore, although the biological meaning for the presence of two groups of oocytes/embryos with different levels of Cpt2 transcripts remains unclear, the data obtained suggest a possible correlation between the levels of Cpt2 expression and embryo developmental competence.},

A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent. A method is described for converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well. In addition, the construction has some interesting theoretical consequences, including a set of general upper bounds on the complexity of any strong learning algorithm as a function of the allowed error ∈. {\textcopyright} 1990, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The first procedure involves reaction of all U-like and G-like residues with N-cyclohexyl-N′-$\beta$-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethylcarbodiimide p-tosylate (CMC), followed by alkaline removal of all CMC groups except those linked to the N3 of $\Psi$. This stops reverse transcription, resulting in a gel band which identifies the U residue. The second procedure is uridine-specific hydrazinolysis which cleaves the RNA chain at all U residues and produces a gel band upon reverse transcription. $\Psi$ residues, being resistant to hydrazinolysis, are not cleaved and do not stop reverse transcription. This leads to the absence of a band at $\Psi$ residues. The combined method can also distinguish $\Psi$ from 5-methyluridine, 4-thiouridine, uridine-5-oxyacetic acid, and 2-thio-5-methylaminomethyluridine as shown by treating rRNA and tRNA species known to contain these modified bases at defined sites. By this procedure, four new sites for $\Psi$ in Escherichia coli 23S RNA were discovered, and one was disproven. The four new sites are at positions 2457, 2504, 2580, and 2605. The erroneous site is at position 2555. These four new $\Psi$ residues, which are all in or within 2–3 residues of the peptidyltransferase ring, are thus in a position to play a functional and/or structural role at the peptidyltransferase center. In addition, this work has shown the presence of a new unidentified modified C residue at position 2501, also in the peptidyltransferase ring. {\textcopyright} 1993, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {The epitranscriptomics field has undergone an enormous expansion in the last few years; however, a major limitation is the lack of generic methods to map RNA modifications transcriptome-wide. Here, we show that using direct RNA sequencing, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modifications can be detected with high accuracy, in the form of systematic errors and decreased base-calling qualities. Specifically, we find that our algorithm, trained with m6A-modified and unmodified synthetic sequences, can predict m6A RNA modifications with {\~{}}90{\%} accuracy. We then extend our findings to yeast data sets, finding that our method can identify m6A RNA modifications in vivo with an accuracy of 87{\%}. Moreover, we further validate our method by showing that these ‘errors' are typically not observed in yeast ime4-knockout strains, which lack m6A modifications. Our results open avenues to investigate the biological roles of RNA modifications in their native RNA context.},

In order to identify miRNAs and to assess their expression patterns, we sequenced over 250 small RNA libraries from 26 different organ systems and cell types of human and rodents that were enriched in neuronal as well as normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and tissues. We present expression profiles derived from clone count data and provide computational tools for their analysis. Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the differences in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units, and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

All proteins in the complex have been conserved during evolution, and genes that encode the exocyst subunits are present in the genomes of all plants investigated to date. Although the plant exocyst has not been studied in great detail, it is likely that the basic function of the exocyst in vesicle tethering is conserved. Nevertheless, genomic and genetic studies suggest that the exocyst complex in plants may have more diversified roles than that in budding yeast. In this review, we compare the knowledge about the exocyst in plant cells to the well-studied exocyst in budding yeast, in order to explore similarities and differences in expression and function between these organisms, both of which have walled cells.},

abstract = {The mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP) catalytically promotes cotranslational translocation of signal sequence containing proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While the S-domain of SRP binds the N-terminal signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide, the Alu domain of SRP temporarily interferes with the ribosomal elongation cycle until the translocation pore in the membrane is correctly engaged. Here we present biochemical and biophysical evidence for a hierarchical assembly pathway of the SRP Alu domain. The proteins SRP9 and SRP14 first heterodimerize and then initially bind to the Alu RNA 5' domain. This creates the binding site for the Alu RNA 3' domain. Alu RNA then undergoes a large conformational change with the flexibly linked 3' domain folding back by 180 degrees onto the 5' domain complex to form the final compact Alu ribonucleoprotein particle (Alu RNP). We discuss the possible mechanistic consequences of the likely reversibility of this final step with reference to translational regulation by the SRP Alu domain and with reference to the structurally similar Alu RNP retroposition intermediates derived from Alu elements in genomic DNA.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genes often generate a variety of RNA isoforms that can lead to functionally distinct protein variants. The synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms is however poorly characterized. The reason for this is that current methods to quantify RNA metabolism use ‘short-read' sequencing that cannot detect RNA isoforms. Here we present nanopore sequencing-based Isoform Dynamics (nano-ID), a method that detects newly synthesized RNA isoforms and monitors isoform metabolism. nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling, ‘long-read' nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules and machine learning. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their synthesis rate, stability, and splicing pattern. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. And although combined RNA stability correlates with poly(A)-tail length, individual RNA isoforms can deviate significantly. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.},

abstract = {The plastid-bearing members of the Cryptophyta contain two functional eukaryotic genomes of different phylogenetic origin, residing in the nucleus and in the nucleomorph, respectively. These widespread and diverse protists thus offer a unique opportunity to study the coevolution of two different eukaryotic genomes within one group of organisms. In this study, the SSU rRNA genes of both genomes were PCR-amplified with specific primers and phylogenetic analyses were performed on different data sets using different evolutionary models. The results show that the composition of the principal clades obtained from the phylogenetic analyses of both genes was largely congruent, but striking differences in evolutionary rates were observed. These affected the topologies of the nuclear and nucleomorph phylogenies differently, resulting in long-branch attraction artifacts when simple evolutionary models were applied. Deletion of long-branch taxa stabilized the internal branching order in both phylogenies and resulted in a completely resolved topology in the nucleomorph phylogeny. A comparison of the tree topologies derived from SSU rDNA sequences with characters previously used in cryptophyte systematics revealed that the biliprotein type was congruent, but the type of inner periplast component incongruent, with the molecular trees. The latter is indicative of a hidden cellular dimorphism (cells with two periplast types present in a single clonal strain) of presumably widespread occurrence throughout cryptophyte diversity, which, in consequence, has far-reaching implications for cryptophyte systematics as it is practiced today.},

Here, we demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel and redundant pathway that can polarize the zygote in the absence of ECT-2-dependent cortical flows. This second pathway depends on the polarity protein PAR-2. We show that PAR-2 localizes to the cortex nearest the sperm centrosome even in the absence of cortical flows. Once on the cortex, PAR-2 antagonizes PAR-3-dependent recruitment of myosin, creating myosin flows that transport the anterior PAR complex away from PAR-2 in a positive-feedback loop. We propose that polarity in the C. elegans zygote is initiated by redundant ECT-2- and PAR-2-dependent mechanisms that lower PAR-3 levels locally, triggering a positive-feedback loop that polarizes the entire cortex.},

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrate that RNA synthesis by nucleoli isolated from rat liver cells or by solubilized nucleolar polymerase is not inhibited by $\alpha$-amanitin, whereas this toxin is an effective inhibitor of the extranucleolar polymerase. In contrast, administration of amanitin to intact rats severely reduces synthesis of RNA by liver nucleoli, as shown by the following results obtained 1 hr after injection of the toxin: (a) all species of RNA, including nucleolar RNA, show reduced isotope uptake from an in vivo pulse dose of orotic acid; (b) in vivo methylation of ribosomal RNA is inhibited; (c) the 45S peak of ribosomal RNA precursor disappears from gradients of nuclear RNA; and (d) RNA synthesis in vitro by nucleoli isolated from amanitin-treated rats is inhibited. The contrast between the lack of action of amanitin on RNA synthesis by isolated nucleoli and the effectiveness of the toxin in vivo suggests that ribosomal RNA formation in the intact cell is under an extranucleolar control mechanism sensitive to amanitin. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

abstract = {The Alu domain of the mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP) comprises the heterodimer of proteins SRP9 and SRP14 bound to the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of SRP RNA. It retards the ribosomal elongation of signal-peptide-containing proteins before their engagement with the translocation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report two crystal structures of the heterodimer SRP9/14 bound either to the 5' domain or to a construct containing both 5' and 3' domains. We present a model of the complete Alu domain that is consistent with extensive biochemical data. SRP9/14 binds strongly to the conserved core of the 5' domain, which forms a U-turn connecting two helical stacks. Reversible docking of the more weakly bound 3' domain might be functionally important in the mechanism of translational regulation. The Alu domain structure is probably conserved in other cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles and retroposition intermediates containing SRP9/14-bound RNAs transcribed from Alu repeats or related elements in genomic DNA.},

Experimental evidence is presented showing that the Alu repeat promoters are organised in a bipartite structure similar to the split tRNA promoters as suggested by DNA sequence homology. Furthermore, by combining fragments from efficiently and inefficiently transcribed natural Alu repeats in several recombinant clones, it was possible to investigate the regions responsible for their differences. It is clear that, apart from the short stretches of homology with the tRNA consensus sequence, there is very little constraint in the promoter sequences. However, our studies indicate that some influence on the efficiency of transcription may be exerted by regions outside the accepted promoter components.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a prevalent post-transcriptional process, which is not only important to normal cellular function but is also involved in human diseases. The newly developed second generation sequencing technique provides high-throughput data (RNA-seq data) to study alternative splicing events in different types of cells. Here, we present a computational method, SpliceMap, to detect splice junctions from RNA-seq data. This method does not depend on any existing annotation of gene structures and is capable of finding novel splice junctions with high sensitivity and specificity. It can handle long reads (50-100 nt) and can exploit paired-read information to improve mapping accuracy. Several parameters are included in the output to indicate the reliability of the predicted junction and help filter out false predictions. We applied SpliceMap to analyze 23 million paired 50-nt reads from human brain tissue. The results show at this depth of sequencing, RNA-seq can support reliable detection of splice junctions except for those that are present at very low level. Compared to current methods, SpliceMap can achieve 12{\%} higher sensitivity without sacrificing specificity.},

abstract = {Transposable element (TE)-derived sequences comprise half of the human genome and DNA methylome and are presumed to be densely methylated and inactive. Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation status within 928 TE subfamilies in human embryonic and adult tissues identified unexpected tissue-specific and subfamily-specific hypomethylation signatures. Genes proximal to tissue-specific hypomethylated TE sequences were enriched for functions important for the relevant tissue type, and their expression correlated strongly with hypomethylation within the TEs. When hypomethylated, these TE sequences gained tissue-specific enhancer marks, including monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and occupancy by p300, and a majority exhibited enhancer activity in reporter gene assays. Many such TEs also harbored binding sites for transcription factors that are important for tissue-specific functions and showed evidence of evolutionary selection. These data suggest that sequences derived from TEs may be responsible for wiring tissue type-specific regulatory networks and may have acquired tissue-specific epigenetic regulation.},

abstract = {As the initial barrier to viral entry, the plasma membrane along with the membrane trafficking machinery and cytoskeleton are of fundamental importance in the viral cycle. However, little is known about the contribution of plasma membrane dynamics during early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Considering that ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) regulates cellular invasion via several microorganisms by coordinating membrane trafficking, our aim was to study the function of Arf6-mediated membrane dynamics on HIV-1 entry and infection of T lymphocytes. We observed that an alteration of the Arf6-guanosine 5'-diphosphate/guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP/GDP) cycle, by GDP-bound or GTP-bound inactive mutants or by specific Arf6 silencing, inhibited HIV-1 envelope-induced membrane fusion, entry, and infection of T lymphocytes and permissive cells, regardless of viral tropism. Furthermore, cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission of primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes was inhibited by Arf6 knockdown. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that Arf6 mutants provoked the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-biphosphate-associated structures on the plasma membrane of permissive cells, without affecting CD4-viral attachment but impeding CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry. Arf6 silencing or its mutants did not affect fusion, entry, and infection of vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped viruses or ligand-induced CXCR4 or CCR5 endocytosis, both clathrin-dependent processes. Therefore we propose that efficient early HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T lymphocytes requires Arf6-coordinated plasma membrane dynamics that promote viral fusion and entry.},

abstract = {The genus Chlamydomonas (including Chloromonas) is one of the largest green algal genera comprising more than 600 species. To initiate a comprehensive analysis of the phylogeny and systematics of the genus, we determined nuclear-encoded SSU rRNA sequences from 32 strains of Chlamydomonas, Chloromonas and Chlorogonium with emphasis on oogamous taxa and related strains, and incorporated these into global molecular phylogenetic analyses of 132 strains of Chlorophyceae. In addition, we studied the morphology and reproduction of oogamous and related strains by light microscopy. We recognize and designate 18 monophyletic lineages (clades) within the Chlorophyceae, 11 of which are confined to the CW (basal bodies displaced clockwise) subgroup. The majority of clades recognized within the Chlorophyceae do not correspond to any of the traditional classification systems, which are still largely based on the organization level. Strains assigned to Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas were found in seven different clades confirming the polyphyly of the two genera as presently conceived. To initiate the taxonomic revision of Chlamydomonas, C. reinhardtii is proposed as the conserved type of the genus. In consequence, species in clades other than the clade containing C. reinhardtii must be transferred to other genera, a process initiated in this contribution. The oogamous strains studied represent a monophyletic lineage, which is described as Oogamochlamys gen. nov. comprising three species (O. gigantea, O. zimbabwiensis and O. ettlii spec. nov.). The sister clade to Oogamochlamys consists of isogamous strains characterized by chloroplasts with incisions and is described as Lobochlamys gen. nov. with two species (L. culleus and L. segnis). Another clade is characterized by asteroid or perforated, parietal chloroplasts and contains the type species of Chloromonas (C. reticulata). Thus, the polyphyletic Chloromonas (traditionally defined as "Chlamydomonas without pyrenoids") can be legitimized as a monophyletic genus by restriction to this clade and is here emended on the basis of chloroplast characters (the clade contains strains with or without pyrenoids thus rejecting the character "absence of pyrenoids").},

abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

The facility is based on ten 3 m3 tubular photobioreactors operated in continuous mode for 2 years, data of Scenedesmus almeriensis productivity but also of nutrients and power consumption from this facility being used. The yield of the facility was close to maximum expected for the location of Almer{\'{i}}a, the annual production capacity being 3.8 t/year (90 t/ha{\textperiodcentered}year) and the photosynthetic efficiency being 3.6{\%}. The production cost was 69 €/kg. Economic analysis shows that labor and depreciation are the major factors contributing to this cost. Simplification of the technology and scale-up to a production capacity of 200 t/year allows to reduce the production cost up to 12.6 €/kg. Moreover, to reduce the microalgae production cost to approaches the energy or commodities markets it is necessary to reduce the photobioreactor cost (by simplifying its design or materials used), use waste water and flue gases, and reduce the power consumption and labor required for the production step. It can be concluded that although it has been reported that production of biofuels from microalgae is relatively close to being economically feasible, data here reported demonstrated that to achieve it by using the current production technologies, it is necessary to substantially reduce their costs and to operate them near their optimum values.},

abstract = {Autosomal-recessive loss of the NSUN2 gene has been identified as a causative link to intellectual disability disorders in humans. NSun2 is an RNA methyltransferase modifying cytosine-5 in transfer RNAs (tRNAs), yet the identification of cytosine methylation in other RNA species has been hampered by the lack of sensitive and reliable molecular techniques. Here, we describe miCLIP as an additional approach for identifying RNA methylation sites in transcriptomes. miCLIP is a customized version ofthe individual-nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) method. We confirm site-specific methylation in tRNAs and additional messenger and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, vault ncRNAs contained six NSun2-methylated cytosines, three of which were confirmed by RNA bisulfite sequencing. Using patient cells lacking the NSun2 protein, we further show that loss of cytosine-5 methylation in vault RNAs causes aberrantprocessing into Argonaute-associated small RNA fragments that can function as microRNAs. Thus, impaired processing of vault ncRNA may contribute to the etiology of NSun2-deficiency human disorders},

abstract = {RNA transcripts are subject to posttranscriptional gene regulation involving hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) expressed in a cell-type dependent fashion. We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies, including RNA-seq, have made it possible to move beyond gene expression analysis to study transcriptional events including alternative splicing and gene fusions. Furthermore, recent studies in cancer have suggested the importance of identifying transcriptionally altered loci as biomarkers for improved prognosis and therapy. While many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying novel transcriptional events with RNA-seq, nearly all rely on contrasting known classes of samples, such as tumor and normal. Few tools exist for the unsupervised discovery of such events without class labels. In this paper, we present SigFuge for identifying genomic loci exhibiting differential transcription patterns across many RNA-seq samples. SigFuge combines clustering with hypothesis testing to identify genes exhibiting alternative splicing, or differences in isoform expression. We apply SigFuge to RNA-seq cohorts of 177 lung and 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and identify several cases of differential isoform usage including CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene known to be inactivated in a majority of lung squamous cell tumors. By not restricting attention to known sample stratifications, SigFuge offers a novel approach to unsupervised screening of genetic loci across RNA-seq cohorts. SigFuge is available as an R package through Bioconductor.},

abstract = {An extensive repertoire of modifications is known to underlie the versatile coding, structural and catalytic functions of RNA, but it remains largely uncharted territory. Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {The accurate mapping of reads that span splice junctions is a critical component of all analytic techniques that work with RNA-seq data. We introduce a second generation splice detection algorithm, MapSplice, whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. MapSplice can be applied to both short ({\textless}75 bp) and long reads (≥ 75 bp). MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. Splice junctions derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These combined results indicate that MapSplice is a highly accurate algorithm for the alignment of RNA-seq reads to splice junctions.

abstract = {Structural variants (SVs) are common in the human genome. Because approximately half of the human genome consists of repetitive, transposable DNA sequences, it is plausible that these elements play an important role in generating SVs in humans. Sequencing of the diploid genome of one individual human (HuRef) affords us the opportunity to assess, for the first time, the impact of mobile elements on SVs in an individual in a thorough and unbiased fashion. In this study, we systematically evaluated more than 8000 SVs to identify mobile element-associated SVs as small as 100 bp and specific to the HuRef genome. Combining computational and experimental analyses, we identified and validated 706 mobile element insertion events (including Alu, L1, SVA elements, and nonclassical insertions), which added more than 305 kb of new DNA sequence to the HuRef genome compared with the Human Genome Project (HGP) reference sequence (hg18). We also identified 140 mobile element-associated deletions, which removed ∼126 kb of sequence from the HuRef genome. Overall, ∼10{\%} of the HuRef-specific indels larger than 100 bp are caused by mobile element-associated events. More than one-third of the insertion/deletion events occurred in genic regions, and new Alu insertions occurred in exons of three human genes. Based on the number of insertions and the estimated time to the most recent common ancestor of HuRef and the HGP reference genome, we estimated the Alu, L1, and SVA retrotransposition rates to be one in 21 births, 212 births, and 916 births, respectively. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of mobile element-related structural variants in the complete DNA sequence of an individual and demonstrates that mobile elements play an important role in generating inter-individual structural variation. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G-proteins are intracellular partners of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs act on inactive Galpha.GDP/Gbetagamma heterotrimers to promote GDP release and GTP binding, resulting in liberation of Galpha from Gbetagamma. Galpha.GTP and Gbetagamma target effectors including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases and ion channels. Signaling is terminated by intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha and heterotrimer reformation - a cycle accelerated by 'regulators of G-protein signaling' (RGS proteins). Recent studies have identified several unconventional G-protein signaling pathways that diverge from this standard model. Whereas phospholipase C (PLC) beta is activated by Galpha(q) and Gbetagamma, novel PLC isoforms are regulated by both heterotrimeric and Ras-superfamily G-proteins. An Arabidopsis protein has been discovered containing both GPCR and RGS domains within the same protein. Most surprisingly, a receptor-independent Galpha nucleotide cycle that regulates cell division has been delineated in both Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we revisit classical heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and explore these new, non-canonical G-protein signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Channelrhodopsins act as photoreceptors for control of motility behavior in flagellates and are widely used as genetically targeted tools to optically manipulate the membrane potential of specific cell populations ("optogenetics"). The first two channelrhodopsins were obtained from the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrChR1 and CrChR2). By homology cloning we identified three new channelrhodopsin sequences from the same genus, CaChR1, CyChR1 and CraChR2, from C. augustae, C. yellowstonensis and C. raudensis, respectively. CaChR1 and CyChR1 were functionally expressed in HEK293 cells, where they acted as light-gated ion channels similar to CrChR1. However, both, which are similar to each other, differed from CrChR1 in current kinetics, inactivation, light intensity dependence, spectral sensitivity and dependence on the external pH. These results show that extensive channelrhodopsin diversity exists even within the same genus, Chlamydomonas. The maximal spectral sensitivity of CaChR1 was at 520 nm at pH 7.4, about 40 nm redshifted as compared to that of CrChR1 under the same conditions. CaChR1 was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and exhibited an absorption spectrum identical to the action spectrum of CaChR1-generated photocurrents. The redshifted spectra and the lack of fast inactivation in CaChR1- and CyChR1-generated currents are features desirable for optogenetics applications.},

Since MIR elements ceased to amplify ∼130 myr ago, previous studies primarily focused on their genomic impact, while the issue of their expression has not been extensively addressed. We applied a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to ENCODE RNA-Seq datasets of seven human cell lines and, for the first time, we were able to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single-locus resolution. While the majority of Pol III-transcribed MIR elements are cell-specific, we discovered a small set of ubiquitously transcribed MIRs mapping within Pol II-transcribed genes in antisense orientation that could influence the expression of the overlapping gene. We also identified novel Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs, deriving from transcription of annotated MIR fragments flanked by unique MIR-unrelated sequences, and confirmed the role of Pol III-specific internal promoter elements in MIR transcription. Besides demonstrating widespread transcription at these retrotranspositionally inactive elements in human cells, the ability to profile MIR expression at single-locus resolution will facilitate their study in different cell types and states including pathological alterations.},

abstract = {Background RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are fundamental regulators of cellular biology that affect all steps in the generation and processing of RNA molecules. Recent evidence suggests that regulation of RBPs that modulate both RNA stability and translation may have a profound effect on the proteome. However, regulation of RBPs in clinically relevant experimental conditions has not been studied systematically. Methods We used RNA interactome capture, a method for the global identification of RBPs to characterize the global RNA‐binding proteome (RBPome) associated with polyA-tailed RNA species in murine ciliated epithelial cells of the inner medullary collecting duct. To study regulation of RBPs in a clinically relevant condition, we analyzed hypoxia-associated changes of the RBPome. Results We identified .1000 RBPs that had been previously found using other systems. In addition, we found a number of novel RBPs not identified by previous screens using mouse or human cells, suggesting that these proteins may be specific RBPs in differentiated kidney epithelial cells. We also found quantitative differences in RBP-binding to mRNA that were associated with hypoxia versus normoxia. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the regulation of RBPs through environmental stimuli and provide insight into the biology of hypoxia-response signaling in epithelial cells in the kidney. A repository of the RBPome and proteome in kidney tubular epithelial cells, derived from our findings, is freely accessible online, and may contribute to a better understanding of the role of RNA-protein interactions in kidney tubular epithelial cells, including the response of these cells to hypoxia.},

abstract = {The mechanism that herpesviruses use to enter cells is one of the most complex viral entry mechanisms studied so far. This complexity seems to mount as new participants, both cellular receptors and viral glycoproteins, are identified. Recent structural work on entry glycoproteins gD and gB from herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 has illuminated the functional roles of these glycoproteins in the process of entry. In doing so, it provided information on the mechanism of two critical steps of HSV entry: receptor-mediated activation and membrane fusion. Remarkably, it is becoming clear that herpesviruses have a lot in common with other, simpler viruses.},

abstract = {Background: High-throughput next-generation RNA sequencing has matured into a viable and powerful method for detecting variations in transcript expression and regulation. Proactive quality control is of critical importance as unanticipated biases, artifacts, or errors can potentially drive false associations and lead to flawed results. Results: We have developed the Quality of RNA-Seq Toolset, or QoRTs, a comprehensive, multifunction toolset that assists in quality control and data processing of high-throughput RNA sequencing data. Conclusions: QoRTs generates an unmatched variety of quality control metrics, and can provide cross-comparisons of replicates contrasted by batch, biological sample, or experimental condition, revealing any outliers and/or systematic issues that could drive false associations or otherwise compromise downstream analyses. In addition, QoRTs simultaneously replaces the functionality of numerous other data-processing tools, and can quickly and efficiently generate quality control metrics, coverage counts (for genes, exons, and known/novel splice-junctions), and browser tracks. These functions can all be carried out as part of a single unified data-processing/quality control run, greatly reducing both the complexity and the total runtime of the analysis pipeline. The software, source code, and documentation are available online at http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs.},

High content applications require tools for the automated processing of the large amounts of data. These tools include in general several image processing steps, the extraction of morphological descriptors, and the grouping of cells into phenotype classes according to their descriptors. This phenotyping can be applied in a supervised or an unsupervised manner. Unsupervised methods are suitable for the discovery of formerly unknown phenotypes, which are expected to occur in high-throughput RNAi time-lapse screens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed an unsupervised phenotyping approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with multivariate Gaussian emissions for the detection of knockdown-specific phenotypes in RNAi time-lapse movies. The automated detection of abnormal cell morphologies allows us to assign a phenotypic fingerprint to each gene knockdown. By applying our method to the Mitocheck database, we show that a phenotypic fingerprint is indicative of a gene's function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our fully unsupervised HMM-based phenotyping is able to automatically identify cell morphologies that are specific for a certain knockdown. Beyond the identification of genes whose knockdown affects cell morphology, phenotypic fingerprints can be used to find modules of functionally related genes.},

abstract = {We present a simple method called "ClickSeq" for NGS (next-generation sequencing) library synthesis that uses click chemistry rather than enzymatic reactions for the ligation of Illumina sequencing adaptors. In ClickSeq, randomly primed reverse transcription reactions are supplemented with azido-2′,3′-dideoxynucleotides that randomly terminate DNA synthesis and release 3′-azido-blocked cDNA fragments in a process akin to dideoxy-Sanger sequencing. Purified fragments are "click ligated" via copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition to DNA oligos modified with a 5′-alkyne group. This generates ssDNA molecules containing an unnatural triazole-linked DNA backbone that is sufficiently biocompatible for PCR amplification to generate a cDNA library for RNAseq. Here, we analyze viral RNAs and mRNA to demonstrate that ClickSeq produces unbiased NGS libraries with low error rates comparable to standard methods. Importantly, ClickSeq is robust against common artifacts of NGS such as chimera formation and artifactual recombination with fewer than 3 aberrant events detected per million reads.},

abstract = {Snail family transcription factors are best known for regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Drosophila Snail family member Worniu is specifically transcribed in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) throughout their lifespan, and worniu mutants show defects in neuroblast delamination (a form of EMT). However, the role of Worniu in neuroblasts beyond their formation is unknown. We performed RNA-seq on worniu mutant larval neuroblasts and observed reduced cell-cycle transcripts and increased neural differentiation transcripts. Consistent with these genomic data, worniu mutant neuroblasts showed a striking delay in prophase/metaphase transition by live imaging and increased levels of the conserved neuronal differentiation splicing factor Elav. Reducing Elav levels significantly suppressed the worniu mutant phenotype. We conclude that Worniu is continuously required in neuroblasts to maintain self-renewal by promoting cell-cycle progression and inhibiting premature differentiation.},

Early LC diagnosis is crucial to reduce the high case fatality rate of this disease. In this case–control study, we developed an accurate LC diagnosis test using retrospectively collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human lung tissues and prospectively collected exhaled breath condensates (EBCs). Following international guidelines for diagnostic methods with clinical application, reproducible standard operating procedures (SOP) were established for every step comprising our LC diagnosis method. We analyzed the expression of distinct mRNAs expressed from GATA6 and NKX2-1, key regulators of lung development. The Em/Ad expression ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1 detected in EBCs were combined using linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) into the LC score, which can be used for LC detection. LC score-based diagnosis achieved a high performance in an independent validation cohort. We propose our method as a non-invasive, accurate, and low-price option to complement the success of computed tomography imaging (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) for LC diagnosis.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming available as a routine tool for clinical microbiology. If applied directly on clinical samples, this could further reduce diagnostic times and thereby improve control and treatment. A major bottleneck is the availability of fast and reliable bioinformatic tools. This study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of WGS directly on clinical samples and to develop easy-to-use bioinformatic tools for the analysis of sequencing data. Thirty-five random urine samples from patients with suspected urinary tract infections were examined using conventional microbiology, WGS of isolated bacteria, and direct sequencing on pellets from the urine samples. A rapid method for analyzing the sequence data was developed. Bacteria were cultivated from 19 samples but in pure cultures from only 17 samples. WGS improved the identification of the cultivated bacteria, and almost complete agreement was observed between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibilities. Complete agreement was observed between species identification, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic relationships for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis isolates when the results of WGS of cultured isolates and urine samples were directly compared. Sequencing directly from the urine enabled bacterial identification in polymicrobial samples. Additional putative pathogenic strains were observed in some culture-negative samples. WGS directly on clinical samples can provide clinically relevant information and drastically reduce diagnostic times. This may prove very useful, but the need for data analysis is still a hurdle to clinical implementation. To overcome this problem, a publicly available bioinformatic tool was developed in this study.},

abstract = {In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone-Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in ℝn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm.

Furthermore, no discrete phycobilisome-type aggregates have thus far been observed in the Cryptophyceae. Structurally, although not necessarily functionally, this is a radical difference. The width of the intrathylakoidal spaces can vary but is generally about 200-300 A. While the thylakoid membranes are usually closely aligned, grana-type fusions do not occur. In Chroomonas these membranes evidence an extensive periodic display with a spacing on the order of 140-160 A. This periodicity is restricted to the membranes and has not been observed in the electron-opaque intrathylakoidal matrix.},

Although Tr. beigelii could only be assigned a definite pathogenic role in 6 cases of genital white piedra, and in one case of peritonitis associated with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, we believe that this organism was pathogenic in many cases of skin infection.

abstract = {Motivation: Recent imaging technologies allow for high-throughput tracking of cells as they migrate, divide, express fluorescent markers, and change their morphology. The interpretation of these data requires unbiased, efficient statistical methods that model the dynamics of cell phenotypes. Results: We introduce treeHFM, a probabilistic model which generalizes the theory of hidden Markov models to tree structured data. While accounting for the entire genealogy of a cell, treeHFM categorizes cells according to their primary phenotypic features. It models all relevant events in a cell's life, including cell division, and thereby enables the analysis of event order and cell fate heterogeneity. Simulations show higher accuracy in predicting correct state labels when modeling the more complex, tree-shaped dependency of samples over standard HMM modeling. Applying treeHFM to time lapse images of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, we demonstrate that progenitor cells undergo a well-ordered sequence of differentiation events. Availability: The treeHFM is implemented in C++. We provide wrapper functions for the programming languages R (CRAN package, https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=treeHFM and Matlab (available at Mathworks Central, http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57575-treehfml).

We showed functionally that Wnt promotes oral and inhibits aboral development, as well as repressing the formation of additional Wnt-mediated oral organisers. It is possible to relate the role of Wnt in axial patterning to the broader question of how such a wide variety of body plans evolved from the eumetazoan ancestor, given the remarkably conserved genetic toolkit among metazoans. Our results demonstrate how even a slight initial change in a single gene's expression (temporal or spatial) could provide a radical body plan alteration on which natural selection may act and could eventually lead to the establishment of a new species.},

This identification was based on three consecutive ionic current states that correspond to passage of modified or unmodified CG dinucleotides and their immediate neighbors through the nanopore limiting aperture.

Each experiment analyzed a mixture of cytosine-, 5-methylcytosine-, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-bearing DNA strands that contained a marker that independently established the correct cytosine methylation status at the target CG of each molecule tested. To calculate error rates for these calls, we established decision boundaries using a variety of machine-learning methods. These error rates depended upon the identity of the bases immediately 5' and 3' of the targeted CG dinucleotide, and ranged from 1.7{\%} to 12.2{\%} for a single-pass read. We estimate that Q40 values (0.01{\%} error rates) for methylation status calls could be achieved by reading single molecules 5-19 times depending upon sequence context.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been demonstrated that calling of copy number alterations (CNAs) from amplicon sequencing (AS) data is feasible. Most approaches, however, require non-tumor (germline) DNA for data normalization. Here, we present the method Ioncopy for CNA detection which requires no normal controls and includes a significance assessment for each detected alteration. Ioncopy was evaluated in a cohort of 184 clinically annotated breast carcinomas. A total number of 252 amplifications were detected, of which 183 (72.6{\%}) could be validated by a call of an additional amplicon interrogating the same gene. Moreover, a total number of 33 deletions were found, whereof 27 (81.8{\%}) could be validated. Analyzing the 16 most frequently amplified genes, validation rates of over 89{\%} could be achieved for 11 of these genes. 11 of the top 16 genes showed significant overexpression in the amplified tumors. 89.5{\%} of the HER2-amplified tumors were GRB7 and STARD3 co-amplified, whereas 68.4{\%} of the HER2-amplified tumors had additional MED1 amplifications. Correlations between CNAs measured by amplicons in HER2 exons 19, 20 and 21 were strong (all R {\textgreater} 0.93). AS based detection of HER2 amplifications had a sensitivity of 90.0{\%} and a specificity of 98.8{\%} compared to the gold standard of HER2 immunohistochemistry combined with in situ hybridization. In summary, we developed and validated a novel method for detection and significance assessment of CNAs in amplicon sequencing data. Using Ioncopy, AS offers a straightforward and efficient approach to simultaneously analyze gene amplifications and gene deletions together with simple somatic mutations in a single assay.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes.

abstract = {The upstream G$\gamma$-globin gene cAMP response element (G-CRE) was previously shown to play a role in drug-mediated fetal hemoglobin induction. This effect is achieved via p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent CREB1 and ATF-2 phosphorylation and G-CRE transactivation. Since this motif is also a predicted consensus binding site for cJun we extended our analysis to determine the ability of cJun to transactivate $\gamma$-globin through the G-CRE. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we showed comparable in vivo cJun and CREB1 binding to the G-CRE region. Protein–protein interactions were confirmed between cJun/ATF-2 and CREB1/ATF-2 but not between CREB1 and cJun. However, we observed cJun and CREB1 binding to the G-CRE in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Promoter pull-down assay followed by sequential western blot analysis confirmed co-localization of cJun, CREB1, and ATF-2 on the G-CRE. To show functional relevance, enforced expression studies with pLen-cJun and a G$\gamma$-promoter (-1500 to +36) luciferase reporter were completed; we observed a concentration-dependent increase in luciferase activity with pLen-cJun similar to that produced by CREB1 enforced expression. Moreover, the G/A mutation at -1225 in the G-CRE abolished cJun transactivation. Finally, enforced cJun expression in K562 cells and normal primary erythroid progenitors enhanced endogenous $\gamma$-globin gene expression. We conclude that these data indicate that cJun activates the G$\gamma$-globin promoter via the G-CRE in a manner comparable with CREB1 and propose a model for $\gamma$-globin activation based on DNA–protein interactions in the G-CRE.},

abstract = {VP22 is a structural protein of the herpes simplex virus and has been reported to possess unusual trafficking properties. Here we examined the mechanism of cellular uptake of VP22 using a fusion protein between the C-terminal half of VP22 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Adsorption of VP22-GFP onto a cell surface required heparan sulfate proteoglycans and basic amino acids, in particular, Arg-164 of VP22. Inhibitor treatment, RNA interference, expression of dominant-negative mutant genes, and confocal microscopy all indicated that VP22-GFP enters cells through an endocytic pathway independent of clathrin and caveolae but dependent on dynamin and Arf6 activity. As with CD59 (a lipid raft marker), cell-surface VP22-GFP signals were resistant to Triton X-100 treatment but only partially overlapped cell-surface CD59 signals. Furthermore, unlike other lipid raft-mediated endocytic pathways, no Rho family GTPase was required for VP22-GFP internalization. Internalized VP22 initially entered early endosomes and then moved to lysosomes and possibly recycling endosomes.},

abstract = {With the number of prognostic and predictive genetic markers in neuro-oncology steadily growing, the need for comprehensive molecular analysis of neuropathology samples has vastly increased. We therefore developed a customized enrichment/hybrid-capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel comprising the entire coding and selected intronic and promoter regions of 130 genes recurrently altered in brain tumors, allowing for the detection of single nucleotide variations, fusions, and copy number aberrations. Optimization of probe design, library generation and sequencing conditions on 150 samples resulted in a 5-workday routine workflow from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sample to neuropathological report. This protocol was applied to 79 retrospective cases with established molecular aberrations for validation and 71 prospective cases for discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Concordance of NGS compared to established, single biomarker methods was 98.0 {\%}, with discrepancies resulting from one case where a TERT promoter mutation was not called by NGS and three ATRX mutations not being detected by Sanger sequencing. Importantly, in samples with low tumor cell content, NGS was able to identify mutant alleles that were not detectable by traditional methods. Information derived from NGS data identified potential targets for experimental therapy in 37/47 (79 {\%}) glioblastomas, 9/10 (90 {\%}) pilocytic astrocytomas, and 5/14 (36 {\%}) medulloblastomas in the prospective target discovery cohort. In conclusion, we present the settings for high-throughput, adaptive next-generation sequencing in routine neuropathology diagnostics. Such an approach will likely become highly valuable in the near future for treatment decision making, as more therapeutic targets emerge and genetic information enters the classification of brain tumors.},

abstract = {High throughput RNA sequencing technologies have dramatically advanced our understanding of transcriptome complexity and regulation. However, these cDNA-based methods lose information contained in biological RNA because the copied reads are short or because modifications are not carried forward in cDNA. Here we address these limitations using a native poly(A) RNA sequencing strategy developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Our study focused on poly(A) RNA isolated from the human cell line GM12878, from which we sequenced approximately 9.9 million individual aligned strands. These native RNA sequence reads had an N50 length of 1334 bases, and a maximum length of 22,000 bases. A total of 78,199 high-confidence isoforms were identified by combining long nanopore reads with short higher accuracy Illumina reads. Among these isoforms, over 50{\%} are not present in GENCODE v24. We describe strategies for assessing 3'poly(A) tail length, base modifications and transcript haplotypes using this single molecule technology. Together, these nanopore-based techniques are poised to deliver new insights into RNA biology.},

abstract = {The template for RNA polymerase III in vitro transcription found on the human DNA clone pJP53 was shown in the previous paper to enclose a member of the Alu famiy of interspersed repetitive DNA sequences. We have mapped this transcript onto its template in greater detail by comparison of the template DNA sequence to the base composition of the Tl ribonuclease digestion products of the in vitro transcript. We find that the 5' end of the transcript lies in close proximity to the 5' end of the conserved Alu family sequence as analyzed in the preceding paper. The 3' end of the transcript appears to terminate in a U-rich region beyond the region of Alu family sequence conservation. Analysis of cellular RNA by Northern blotting and hybridization with a DNA probe derived from another Alu family transcription template demonstrates abundant representation of sequences homologous to the reiterated DNA. Cytoplasmic, nonpolyadenylated RNA from human and murine cells contains a monodisperse, 300 nucleotide species, recently determined by Weiner (4) to be the 7S RNA. In contrast, the Alu-homologous transcripts are heterodisperse in mRNA and hnRNA, with the highest specific representation of Alu family sequences being found in oligo(dT)-retained hnRNA.},

abstract = {RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a multitude of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes as well as other small RNA genes distributed through the genome. By being sequence-specific, precise and efficient, transcription termination by pol III not only defines the 3′ end of the nascent RNA which directs subsequent association with the stabilizing La protein, it also prevents transcription into downstream DNA and promotes efficient recycling. Each of the RNA polymerases appears to have evolved unique mechanisms to initiate the process of termination in response to different types of termination signals. However, in eukaryotes much less is known about the final stage of termination, destabilization of the elongation complex with release of the RNA and DNA from the polymerase active center. By comparison to pols I and II, pol III exhibits the most direct coupling of the initial and final stages of termination, both of which occur at a short oligo(dT) tract on the non-template strand (dA on the template) of the DNA. While pol III termination is autonomous involving the core subunits C2 and probably C1, it also involves subunits C11, C37 and C53, which act on the pol III catalytic center and exhibit homology to the pol II elongation factor TFIIS and TFIIF$\alpha$/$\beta$ respectively. Here we compile knowledge of pol III termination and associate mutations that affect this process with structural elements of the polymerase that illustrate the importance of C53/37 both at its docking site on the pol III lobe and in the active center. The models suggest that some of these features may apply to the other eukaryotic pols. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcription by Odd Pols.},

abstract = {We present a novel cost function for semi-supervised learning of neural networks that encourages compact clustering of the latent space to facilitate separation. The key idea is to dynamically create a graph over embeddings of labeled and unlabeled samples of a training batch to capture underlying structure in feature space, and use label propagation to estimate its high and low density regions. We then devise a cost function based on Markov chains on the graph that regularizes the latent space to form a single compact cluster per class, while avoiding to disturb existing clusters during optimization. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks and compare to state-of-the art with promising results. Our approach combines the benefits of graph-based regularization with efficient, inductive inference, does not require modifications to a network architecture, and can thus be easily applied to existing networks to enable an effective use of unlabeled data.},

abstract = {Background: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {7SL RNA is an abundant cytoplasmic RNA which functions in protein secretion as a component of the signal recognition particle. Alu sequences are the most abundant family of human and rodent middle repetitive DNA sequences (reviewed in ref. 2). The primary structure of human 7SL RNA consists of an Alu sequence interrupted by a 155-base pair (bp) sequence that is unique to 7SL RNA. In order to obtain information about the evolution of the Alu domain of 7SL RNA, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA copy of Xenopus laevis 7SL RNA and of the 7SL RNA gene of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that the Xenopus sequence is 87{\%} homologous with its human counterpart and the Drosophila 7SL RNA is 64{\%} homologous to both the human and amphibian molecules. Despite the evolutionary distance between the species, significant blocks of homology to both the Alu and 7SL-specific portions of mammalian 7SL RNA can be found in the insect sequence. These results clearly demonstrate that the Alu sequence in 7SL RNA appeared in evolution before the mammalian radiation. We suggest that mammalian Alu sequences were derived from 7SL RNA (or DNA) by a deletion of the central 7SL-specific sequence, and are therefore processed 7SL RNA genes.},

However, while the cost and time have been greatly reduced, the error profiles and limitations of the new platforms differ significantly from those of previous sequencing technologies. The selection of an appropriate sequencing platform for particular types of experiments is an important consideration, and requires a detailed understanding of the technologies available; including sources of error, error rate, as well as the speed and cost of sequencing. We review the relevant concepts and compare the issues raised by the current high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies.

abstract = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

abstract = {Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rules consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly via additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish. Training basecallers on taxon-specific data resulted in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network was able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ({\&}{\#}039;polishing{\&}{\#}039;) with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy, so basecaller choice is still relevant even when Nanopolish is used.},

In this computer study we have compared the density of ten consensus transcription factor binding sites in a set of human mature mRNA, human promotors and Alu repeats. Our results indicate that Aln retroposons and promotor sequences have significantly higher mean density of these sites compared to RNAs.

abstract = {The mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP) is a small cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein required for the cotranslational targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The heterodimeric protein subunit SRP9/14 was previously shown to be essential for SRP to cause pausing in the elongation of secretory protein translation. RNase protection and filter binding experiments have shown that binding of SRP9/14 to SRP RNA depends solely on sequences located in a domain of SRP RNA that is strongly homologous to the Alu family of repetitive DNA sequences. In addition, the use of hydroxyl radicals, as RNA-cleaving reagents, has revealed four distinct regions in this domain that are in close contact with SRP9/14. Surprisingly, the nucleotide sequence in one of these contact sites, predicted to be mostly single stranded, was found to be extremely conserved in SRP RNAs of evolutionarily distant organisms ranging from eubacteria and archaebacteria to yeasts and higher eucaryotic cells. This finding suggests that SRP9/14 homologs may also exist in these organisms, where they possibly contribute to the regulation of protein synthesis similar to that observed for mammalian SRP in vitro.},

abstract = {Abstract DNA damage response (DDR) is a coordinated network of diverse cellular processes including the detection, signaling, and repair of DNA lesions, the adjustment of metabolic network and cell fate determination. To deal with the unavoidable DNA damage caused by either endogenous or exogenous stresses, the cells need to reshape the gene expression profile to allow efficient transcription and translation of DDR-responsive messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and to repress the nonessential mRNAs. A predominant method to adjust RNA fate is achieved by modulating the 3?-end oligo(A) or poly(A) length via the opposing actions of polyadenylation and deadenylation. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) and the carbon catabolite repressor 4 (CCR4)-Not complex, the major executors of deadenylation, are indispensable to DDR and genomic integrity in eukaryotic cells. PARN modulates cell cycle progression by regulating the stabilities of mRNAs and microRNA (miRNAs) involved in the p53 pathway and contributes to genomic stability by affecting the biogenesis of noncoding RNAs including miRNAs and telomeric RNA. The CCR4-Not complex is involved in diverse pathways of DDR including transcriptional regulation, signaling pathways, mRNA stabilities, translation regulation, and protein degradation. The RNA targets of deadenylases are tuned by the DDR signaling pathways, while in turn the deadenylases can regulate the levels of DNA damage-responsive proteins. The mutual feedback between deadenylases and the DDR signaling pathways allows the cells to precisely control DDR by dynamically adjusting the levels of sensors and effectors of the DDR signaling pathways. Here, the diverse functions of deadenylases in DDR are summarized and the underlying mechanisms are proposed according to recent findings.

On the basis of gene expression patterns, we infer that inherited kidney diseases that arise from distinct genetic mutations but share the same phenotypic manifestation originate from the same differentiated cell type.We also found that the collecting duct in kidneys of adult mice generates a spectrum of cell types through a newly identified transitional cell. Computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo lineage tracing revealed that intercalated cells and principal cells undergo transitionsmediated by the Notch signaling pathway. In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.},

abstract = {The heat shock response (HSR) is critical for survival of all organisms. However, its scope, extent, and the molecular mechanism of regulation are poorly understood. Here we show that the genome-wide transcriptional response to heat shock in mammals is rapid and dynamic and results in induction of several hundred and repression of several thousand genes. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the "master regulator" of the HSR, controls only a fraction of heat shock-induced genes and does so by increasing RNA polymerase II release from promoter-proximal pause. Notably, HSF2 does not compensate for the lack of HSF1. However, serum response factor appears to transiently induce cytoskeletal genes independently of HSF1. The pervasive repression of transcription is predominantly HSF1-independent and is mediated through reduction of RNA polymerase II pause release. Overall, mammalian cells orchestrate rapid, dynamic, and extensive changes in transcription upon heat shock that are largely modulated at pause release, and HSF1 plays a limited and specialized role.},

abstract = {Previously published molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Chaetophorales (Chlorophyceae) suffered from limited taxon sampling (six genera with only a single species per genus). To test the monophyly of species-rich genera, and to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among families and genera in the Chaetophorales, we determined nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA sequences from 30 strains of Chaetophorales, performed phylogenetic analyses using various methods, and screened clades for support by unique molecular synapomorphies in the SSU rRNA secondary structure. The Schizomeridaceae and the weakly supported Aphanochaetaceae were recovered as basal lineages. The derived family Chaetophoraceae diverged into two clades: the ‘‘Uronema clade'' containing unbranched filaments, and a sister clade designated as ‘‘branched Chaetophoraceae'' comprising Chaetophora, Stigeoclonium, Draparnaldia, Caespitella, and Fritschiella. Although some terminal clades corresponded to genera described (e.g., Caespitella and Draparnaldia), other clades were in conflict with traditional taxonomic designations. Especially, the genera Stigeoclonium and Chaetophora were shown to be polyphyletic. The globose species Chaetophora elegans was unrelated to lobate Chaetophora spp. (e.g., Chaetophora lobata). Since the original description of Chaetophora referred to a lobate thallus organization, the latter clade represented Chaetophora sensu stricto. In consequence, C. lobata was designated as lectotype of Chaetophora. Two Stigeoclonium species, Stigeoclonium farctum Berthold and Stigeoclonium ‘Longipilus', diverged independently from the type species of Stigeoclonium, Stigeoclonium tenue (C. Agardh) Ku¨tz. These results indicated that some commonly used taxonomic characters are either homoplasious or plesiomorphic and call for a reevaluation of the systematics of the Chaetophorales using novel morphological and molecular approaches.},

abstract = {Recently discovered new chemical entities in RNA modifications have involved surprising functional groups that enlarge the chemical space of RNA. Using LC-MS, we found over 100 signals of RNA constituents that contained a ribose moiety in tRNAs from E. coli. Feeding experiments with variegated stable isotope labeled compounds identified 37 compounds that are new structures of RNA modifications. One structure was elucidated by deuterium exchange and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The structure of msms2 i6 A (2-methylthiomethylenethio-N6-isopentenyl-adenosine) was confirmed by methione-D3 feeding experiments and by synthesis of the nucleobase. The msms2 i6 A contains a thioacetal, shown in vitro to be biosynthetically derived from ms2 i6 A by the radical-SAM enzyme MiaB. This enzyme performs thiomethylation, forming ms2 i6 A from i6 A in a first turnover. The new thioacetal is formed by a second turnover. Along with the pool of 36 new modifications, this work describes a new layer of RNA modification chemistry.},

abstract = {The Cryptophyta comprise photoautotrophic protists with complex plastids which harbor a remnant eukaryotic nucleus (nucleomorph) and a few heterotrophic taxa which either lack a plastid (Goniomonas) or contain a complex plastid devoid of pigments (Ieucoplast; Chilomonas). To resolve the phylogenetic relationships between photosynthetic, leucoplast-containing and aplastidial taxa, we determined complete nuclear-encoded SSU rRNA-sequences from 12 cryptophyte taxa representing the genera Cryptomonas, Chilomonas, Rhodomonas, Chroomonas, Hemiselmis, Proteomonas and Teleaulax and, as an outgroup taxon, Cyanoptyche gloeocystis (Glaucocystophyta). Phylogenetic analyses of SSU rRNA sequences from a total of 24 cryptophyte taxa rooted with 4 glaucocystophyte taxa using distance, parsimony and likelihood methods as well as LogDet transformations invariably position the aplastidial genus Goniomonas as a sister taxon to a monophyletic lineage consisting of all plastid containing cryptophytes including Chilomonas. Among the plastid-containing taxa, we identify six major clades each supported by high bootstrap values: clade I (Cryptomonas and Chilomonas), clade II (Rhodomonas, Pyrenomonas, Rhinomonas and Storeatula), clade III (Guillardia and the 'unidentified cryptophyte' strain CCMP 325), clade IV (Teleaulax and Geminigera), clade V (Proteomonas) and clade VI (Hemiselmis, Chroomonas and Komma). Clade I (Cryptomonas and Chilomonas) represents a sister group to clades II-VI which together form a monophyletic lineage; the phylogenetic relationships between clades II-VI remain largely unresolved. Chilomonas is positioned within the Cryptomonas clade and thus presumably evolved from a photosynthetic taxon of this genus. In our analysis the characters blue and red pigmentation do not correspond with a basal subdivision of the phylum, thus rejecting this character for higher-level classification of cryptophytes. However, different spectroscopic subtypes of phycoerythrin (PE I-III) and phycocyanin (PC II-IV) represent informative characters at a lower taxonomic level. Phycocyanin types are confined to the later diverging clade VI and within Hemiselmis, a species with phycocyanin is monophyletic with two species containing phycoerythrin. This supports previous molecular studies which demonstrated that the $\beta$ subunit of all cryptophyte biliproteins, regardless of spectroscopic type, is phylogenetically derived from the red algal $\beta$-phycoerythrin gene family, therefore the cryptophyte phycocyanins presumably originated by chromophore replacement from phycoerythrin. Our phylogenetic analysis does not support a previous suggestion that the aplastidial cryptophyte Goniomonas evolved from an ancestor containing a complex cryptomonadtype plastid by nucleomorph and plastid loss.},

We used comprehensive transcriptome analysis of 622 single mouse neurons to classify them in an unbiased manner, independent of any a priori knowledge of sensory subtypes. Our results reveal eleven types: three distinct low-threshold mechanoreceptive neurons, two proprioceptive, and six principal types of thermosensitive, itch sensitive, type C low-threshold mechanosensitive and nociceptive neurons with markedly different molecular and operational properties. Confirming previously anticipated major neuronal types, our results also classify and provide markers for new, functionally distinct subtypes. For example, our results suggest that itching during inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is linked to a distinct itch-generating type. We demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective strategy for dissecting sensory responsive cells into distinct neuronal types. The resulting catalog illustrates the diversity of sensory types and the cellular complexity underlying somatic sensation.},

abstract = {We developed a novel technique, called pseudouridine site identification sequencing (PSI-seq), for the transcriptome-wide mapping of pseudouridylation sites with single-base resolution from cellular RNAs based on the induced termination of reverse transcription specifically at pseudouridines following CMCT treatment. PSI-seq analysis of RNA samples from S. cerevisiae correctly detected all of the 43 known pseudouridines in yeast 18S and 25S ribosomal RNA with high specificity. Moreover, application of PSI-seq to the yeast transcriptome revealed the presence of site-specific pseudouridylation within dozens of mRNAs, including RPL11a, TEF1, and other genes implicated in translation. To identify the mechanisms responsible for mRNA pseudouridylation, we genetically deleted candidate pseudouridine synthase (Pus) enzymes and reconstituted their activities in vitro. These experiments demonstrated that the Pus1 enzyme was necessary and sufficient for pseudouridylation of RPL11a mRNA, whereas Pus4 modified TEF1 mRNA, and Pus6 pseudouridylated KAR2 mRNA. Finally, we determined that modification of RPL11a at $\Psi$ -68 was observed in RNA from the related yeast S. mikitae, and $\Psi$ -239 in TEF1 mRNA was maintained in S. mikitae as well as S. pombe, indicating that these pseudouridylations are ancient, evolutionarily conserved RNA modifications. This work establishes that site-specific pseudouridylation of eukaryotic mRNAs is a genetically programmed RNA modification that naturally occurs in multiple yeast transcripts via distinct mechanisms, suggesting that mRNA pseudouridylation may provide an important novel regulatory function. The approach and strategies that we report here should be generally applicable to the discovery of pseudouridylation, or other RNA modifications, in diverse biological contexts.},

abstract = {Gene expression is dynamically regulated in a variety of mammalian physiologies. During mammalian aging, there are changes that occur in protein expression that are highly controlled by the regulatory steps in transcription, post-transcription, and post-translation. Although there are global profiles of human transcripts during the aging processes available, the mechanism(s) by which transcripts are differentially expressed between young and old cohorts remains unclear. Here, we report on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from young and old cohorts. An m6A RNA profile identified a decrease in overall RNA methylation during the aging process as well as the predominant modification on proteincoding mRNAs. The m6A-modified transcripts tend to be more highly expressed than nonmodified ones. Among the many methylated mRNAs, those of DROSHA and AGO2 were heavily methylated in young PBMCs which coincided with a decreased steady-state level of AGO2 mRNA in the old PBMC cohort. Similarly, downregulation of AGO2 in proliferating human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) also correlated with a decrease in AGO2 mRNA modifications and steady-state levels. In addition, the overexpression of RNA methyltransferases stabilized AGO2 mRNA but not DROSHA and DICER1 mRNA in HDFs. Moreover, the abundance of miRNAs also changed in the young and old PBMCs which are possibly due to a correlation with AGO2 expression as observed in AGO2-depleted HDFs. Taken together, we uncovered the role of mRNA methylation on the abundance of AGO2 mRNA resulting in the repression of miRNA expression during the process of human aging.},

abstract = {Alu elements belong to the primate-specific SINE family of retrotransposons and constitute almost 11{\%} of the human genome. Alus are transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III and are inserted back into the genome with the help of autonomous LINE retroelements. Since Alu elements are preferentially located near to or within gene-rich regions, they can affect gene expression by distinct mechanisms of action at both DNA and RNA levels. In this review we focus on recent advances of how Alu elements are pervasively involved in gene regulation. We discuss the impacts of Alu DNA sequences that are in close proximity to genes, Pol-III-transcribed free Alu RNAs, and Pol-II-transcribed Alu RNAs that are embedded within coding or noncoding RNA transcripts. The recent elucidation of Alu functions reveals previously underestimated roles of these selfish or junk DNA sequences in the human genome. Primate-specific Alus constitute 11{\%} of the human genome, with {\textgreater}1 million copies, and their genomic distribution is biased toward gene-rich regions. The functions of Alus are highly associated with their sequence and structural features. Alus can regulate gene expression by serving as cis elements. Pol-III-transcribed free Alus mainly affect Pol II transcription and mRNA translation in trans. Embedded Alus within Pol-II-transcribed mRNAs can impact their host gene expression through the regulation of alternative splicing, and RNA stability and translation. Nearly half of annotated Alus are located in introns; RNA pairing formed by orientation-opposite Alus across introns promotes circRNA biogenesis.},

abstract = {In the paper, we consider sequential decision problems with uncertainty, represented as decision trees. Sensitivity analysis is always a crucial element of decision making and in decision trees it often focuses on probabilities. In the stochastic model considered, the user often has only limited information about the true values of probabilities. We develop a framework for performing sensitivity analysis of optimal strategies accounting for this distributional uncertainty. We design this robust optimization approach in an intuitive and not overly technical way, to make it simple to apply in daily managerial practice. The proposed framework allows for (1) analysis of the stability of the expected-value-maximizing strategy and (2) identification of strategies which are robust with respect to pessimistic/optimistic/mode-favoring perturbations of probabilities. We verify the properties of our approach in two cases: (a) probabilities in a tree are the primitives of the model and can be modified independently; (b) probabilities in a tree reflect some underlying, structural probabilities, and are interrelated. We provide a free software tool implementing the methods described.},

abstract = {Nucleic acid amplification and quantification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most sensitive and powerful tools for clinical laboratories, precision medicine, personalized medicine, agricultural science, forensic science and environmental science. Ultrafast multiplex PCR, characterized by low power consumption, compact size and simple operation, is ideal for timely diagnosis at the point-of-care (POC). Although several fast/ultrafast PCR methods have been proposed, the use of a simple and robust PCR thermal cycler remains challenging for POC testing. Here, we present an ultrafast photonic PCR method using plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat conversion via photon–electron–phonon coupling. We demonstrate an efficient photonic heat converter using a thin gold (Au) film due to its plasmon-assisted high optical absorption (approximately 65{\%} at 450 nm, the peak wavelength of heat source light-emitting diodes (LEDs)). The plasmon-excited Au film is capable of rapidly heating the surrounding solution to over 150 °C within 3 min. Using this method, ultrafast thermal cycling (30 cycles; heating and cooling rate of 12.79±0.93 °C s−1 and 6.6±0.29 °C s−1, respectively) from 55 °C (temperature of annealing) to 95 °C (temperature of denaturation) is accomplished within 5 min. Using photonic PCR thermal cycles, we demonstrate here successful nucleic acid ($\lambda$-DNA) amplification. Our simple, robust and low cost approach to ultrafast PCR using an efficient photonic-based heating procedure could be generally integrated into a variety of devices or procedures, including on-chip thermal lysis and heating for isothermal amplifications.},

abstract = {Alu repeats in K562 cells are unusually hypomethylated and far more actively transcribed than those in other human cell lines and somatic tissues. Also, the level of Alu RNA in K562 cells is relatively insensitive to cell stresses, namely heat shock, adenovirus infection and treatment with cycloheximide, which increase the abundance of Alu RNA in HeLa and 293 cells. Recent advances in understanding the interactions between DNA methylation, transcriptional activation and chromatin conformation reveal reasons for the constitutively high level of Alu expression in K562 cells. Methylation represses transcription of transiently transfected Alu templates in all cell lines tested but cell stresses do not relieve this repression suggesting that they activate Alu transcription through another pathway. A relatively large fraction of the Alus within K562 chromatin is accessible to restriction enzyme cleavage and cell stresses increase the chromatin accessibility of Alus in HeLa and 293 cells. Cell stress evidently activates Alu transcription by rapidly remodeling chromatin to recruit additional templates.},

However until recently nanopore sequencing has been mainly applied to small genomes, due to the limited output attainable. We present nanopore sequencing and assembly of the GM12878 Utah/Ceph human reference genome generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION and R9.4 version chemistry. We generated 91.2 Gb of sequence data ({\~{}}30x theoretical coverage) from 39 flowcells. De novo assembly yielded a highly complete and contiguous assembly (NG50 {\~{}}3Mb). We observed considerable variability in homopolymeric tract resolution between different basecallers. The data permitted sensitive detection of both large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. Further we developed a new approach exploiting the long-read capability of this system and found that adding an additional 5x-coverage of "ultra-long" reads (read N50 of 99.7kb) more than doubled the assembly contiguity. Modelling the repeat structure of the human genome predicts extraordinarily contiguous assemblies may be possible using nanopore reads alone. Portable de novo sequencing of human genomes may be important for rapid point-of-care diagnosis of rare genetic diseases and cancer, and monitoring of cancer progression.

@article{Becker2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Land plants (embryophytes) evolved from streptophyte green algae, a small group of freshwater algae ranging from scaly, unicellular flagellates (Mesostigma) to complex, filamentous thalli with branching, cell differentiation and apical growth (Charales). Streptophyte algae and embryophytes form the division Streptophyta, whereas the remaining green algae are classified as Chlorophyta. The Charales (stoneworts) are often considered to be sister to land plants, suggesting progressive evolution towards cellular complexity within streptophyte green algae. Many cellular (e.g. phragmoplast, plasmodesmata, hexameric cellulose synthase, structure of flagellated cells, oogamous sexual reproduction with zygote retention) and physiological characters (e.g. type of photorespiration, phytochrome system) originated within streptophyte algae. RECENT PROGRESS: Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that Mesostigma (flagellate) and Chlorokybus (sarcinoid) form the earliest divergence within streptophytes, as sister to all other Streptophyta including embryophytes. The question whether Charales, Coleochaetales or Zygnematales are the sister to embryophytes is still (or, again) hotly debated. Projects to study genome evolution within streptophytes including protein families and polyadenylation signals have been initiated. In agreement with morphological and physiological features, many molecular traits believed to be specific for embryophytes have been shown to predate the Chlorophyta/Streptophyta split, or to have originated within streptophyte algae. Molecular phylogenies and the fossil record allow a detailed reconstruction of the early evolutionary events that led to the origin of true land plants, and shaped the current diversity and ecology of streptophyte green algae and their embryophyte descendants. CONCLUSIONS: The Streptophyta/Chlorophyta divergence correlates with a remarkably conservative preference for freshwater/marine habitats, and the early freshwater adaptation of streptophyte algae was a major advantage for the earliest land plants, even before the origin of the embryo and the sporophyte generation. The complete genomes of a few key streptophyte algae taxa will be required for a better understanding of the colonization of terrestrial habitats by streptophytes.},

abstract = {Recent studies of transcription have revealed a level of complexity not previously appreciated even a few years ago, both in the intricate use of post-initiation control and the mass production of rapidly degraded transcripts. Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, NET-seq), based on deep sequencing of 3ĝ€2 ends of nascent transcripts associated with RNA polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of NET-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the Rpd3S deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present an allele-specific copy number analysis of the in vivo breast cancer genome. We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of “ASCAT profiles” (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy ({\textgreater}2.7n) in 45{\%} of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49{\%}. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in near-triploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost, whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.},

We developed a method called INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) that allows affinity-based isolation of nuclei from individual cell types of a tissue, thereby circumventing the problems associated with mechanical purification techniques. In this method nuclei are affinity-labeled through transgenic expression of a biotinylated nuclear envelope protein in the cell type of interest. Total nuclei are isolated from transgenic plants and biotin-labeled nuclei are then purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, without the need for specialized equipment. INTACT gives high yield and purity of nuclei from the desired cell types, which can be used for genome-wide analysis of gene expression and chromatin features. The entire procedure, from nuclei purification through cDNA preparation or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), can be completed within 2 d. The protocol we present assumes that transgenic lines are already available, and includes procedural details for amplification of cDNA or ChIP DNA prior to microarray or deep sequencing analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract Structural variations (SVs) are mutations in the genome of size at least fifty nucleotides. They contribute to the phenotypic differences among healthy individuals, cause severe diseases and even cancers by breaking or linking genes. Thus, it is crucial to systematically profile {\{}SVs{\}} in the genome. In the past decade, many next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based {\{}SV{\}} detection methods have been proposed due to the significant cost reduction of {\{}NGS{\}} experiments and their ability to unbiasedly detect {\{}SVs{\}} to the base-pair resolution. These {\{}SV{\}} detection methods vary in both sensitivity and specificity, since they use different SV-property-dependent and library-property-dependent features. As a result, predictions from different {\{}SV{\}} callers are often inconsistent. Besides, the noises in the data (both platform-specific sequencing error and artificial chimeric reads) impede the specificity of {\{}SV{\}} detection. Poorly characterized regions in the human genome (e.g., repeat regions) greatly impact the reads mapping and in turn affect the {\{}SV{\}} calling accuracy. Calling of complex {\{}SVs{\}} requires specialized {\{}SV{\}} callers. Apart from accuracy, processing speed of {\{}SV{\}} caller is another factor deciding its usability. Knowing the pros and cons of different {\{}SV{\}} calling techniques and the objectives of the biological study are essential for biologists and bioinformaticians to make informed decisions. This paper describes different components in the {\{}SV{\}} calling pipeline and reviews the techniques used by existing {\{}SV{\}} callers. Through simulation study, we also demonstrate that library properties, especially insert size, greatly impact the sensitivity of different {\{}SV{\}} callers. We hope the community can benefit from this work both in designing new {\{}SV{\}} calling methods and in selecting the appropriate {\{}SV{\}} caller for specific biological studies. },

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in gene regulation. It can be influenced by stochastic events, environmental factors and developmental programs. However, little is known about the natural variation of gene-specific methylation patterns. In this study, we performed quantitative methylation analyses of six differentially methylated imprinted genes (H19, MEG3, LIT1, NESP55, PEG3 and SNRPN), one hypermethylated pluripotency gene (OCT4) and one hypomethylated tumor suppressor gene (APC) in chorionic villus, fetal and adult cortex, and adult blood samples. Both average methylation level and range of methylation variation depended on the gene locus, tissue type and/or developmental stage. We found considerable variability of functionally important methylation patterns among unrelated healthy individuals and a trend toward more similar methylation levels in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. Imprinted genes showed relatively little methylation changes associated with aging in individuals who are {\textgreater}25 years. The relative differences in methylation among neighboring CpGs in the generally hypomethylated APC promoter may not only reflect stochastic fluctuations but also depend on the tissue type. Our results are consistent with the view that most methylation variation may arise after fertilization, leading to epigenetic mosaicism.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: For biological pathways, it is common to measure a gene expression time series after various knockdowns of genes that are putatively involved in the process of interest. These interventional time-resolved data are most suitable for the elucidation of dynamic causal relationships in signaling networks. Even with this kind of data it is still a major and largely unsolved challenge to infer the topology and interaction logic of the underlying regulatory network.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this work, we present a novel model-based approach involving Boolean networks to reconstruct small to medium-sized regulatory networks. In particular, we solve the problem of exact likelihood computation in Boolean networks with probabilistic exponential time delays. Simulations demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach. We apply our method to data of Ivanova et al. (2006), where RNA interference knockdown experiments were used to build a network of the key regulatory genes governing mouse stem cell maintenance and differentiation. In contrast to previous analyses of that data set, our method can identify feedback loops and provides new insights into the interplay of some master regulators in embryonic stem cell development. Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in the statistical language R.

abstract = {Water transport in highly water-permeable membranes is conducted by water-selective pores--namely, water channels. The recent cloning of water channels revealed the water-selective characteristics of these proteins when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or reconstituted in liposomes. Currently, it is assumed that the function of water channels is to transport only water. We now report the cloning of a member of the water channel that also transports nonionic small molecules such as urea and glycerol. We named this channel aquaporin 3 (AQP3) for its predominant water permeability. AQP3 has amino acid sequence identity with major intrinsic protein (MIP) family proteins including AQP-channel-forming integral membrane protein, AQP-collecting duct, MIP, AQP-gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, nodulin 26, and glycerol facilitator (33-42{\%}). Thus, AQP3 is an additional member of the MIP family. Osmotic water permeability of Xenopus oocytes measured by videomicroscopy was 10-fold higher in oocytes injected with AQP3 transcript than with water-injected oocytes. The increase in osmotic water permeability was inhibited by HgCl2, and this effect was reversed by a reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Although to a smaller degree, AQP3 also facilitated the transport of nonionic small solutes such as urea and glycerol, while the previously cloned water channels are permeable only to water when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. AQP3 mRNA was expressed abundantly in kidney medulla and colon. In kidney, it was exclusively immunolocalized at the basolateral membrane of collecting duct cells. AQP3 may function as a water and urea exit mechanism in antidiuresis in collecting duct cells.},

Similarly, in vivo binding studies also reveal that a number of transcription factors normally associated with Pol II transcription, including c-Fos, c-Jun and c-Myc, also tightly associate with most Pol III-transcribed genes. Inhibition of Pol II activity using $\alpha$-amanitin reduced expression of a number of Pol III genes (e.g., U6, hY, HVG), suggesting that Pol II plays an important role in regulating their transcription.

For example, recent work suggests that the long-sought-after target of the analgesic acetaminophen is a neural-specific, alternatively spliced isoform of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1). Several important diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, have been linked with mutations or variations in either cis-acting elements or trans-acting factors that lead to aberrant splicing and abnormal protein production. Correction of erroneous splicing is thus an important goal of molecular therapies. Recent experiments have used modified oligonucleotides to inhibit cryptic exons or to activate exons weakened by mutations, suggesting that these reagents could eventually lead to effective therapies.},

abstract = {Alu elements are the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome; they emerged from the signal recognition particle RNA gene and are composed of two related but distinct monomers (left and right arms). Alu RNAs transcribed from these elements are present at low levels at normal cell growth but various stress conditions increase their abundance. Alu RNAs are known to bind the cognate proteins SRP9/14. We purified synthetic Alu RNP, composed of Alu RNA in complex with SRP9/14, and investigated the effects of Alu RNPs and naked Alu RNA on protein translation. We found that the dimeric Alu RNP and the monomeric left and right Alu RNPs have a general dose-dependent inhibitory effect on protein translation. In the absence of SRP9/14, Alu RNA has a stimulatory effect on all reporter mRNAs. The unstable structure of sRight RNA suggests that the differential activities of Alu RNP and Alu RNA may be explained by conformational changes in the RNA. We demonstrate that Alu RNPs and Alu RNAs do not stably associate with ribosomes during translation and, based on the analysis of polysome profiles and synchronized translation, we show that Alu RNP and Alu RNA regulate translation at the level of initiation.},

Twelve groups of strains were distinguished by light and whole mount electron microscopy using a combination of characters, mainly cell size, type of periplast and presence/absence and number of pyrenoids. However, characters previously used to distinguish Cryptomonas from Campylomonas (e.g. the type of periplast: polygonal periplast plates vs. a continuous periplast sheet) were found to occur together in dimorphic strains, indicating that periplast types relate to different life-history stages of a single taxon. To evaluate the taxonomic significance of the type of periplast and other characters previously used to distinguish genera and species, representatives of each strain group were subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses using two nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (ITS2, partial LSU rDNA) and a nucleomorph ribosomal gene (SSU rDNA). The results of the phylogenetic study provide molecular evidence for a life history-dependent dimorphism in the genus Cryptomonas: the genus Campylomonas represents the alternate morph of Cryptomonas. Campylomonas and Chilomonas are reduced to synonyms of Cryptomonas, the genus Cryptomonas is revised and typified, two new species are described and six species are emended.},

abstract = {Alu retrotransposons evolved from 7SL RNA -65 million years ago and underwent several rounds of massive expansion in primate genomes. Consequently, the human genome currently harbors 1.1 million Alu copies. Some of these copies remain actively mobile and continue to produce both genetic variation and diseases by "jumping" to new genomic locations. However, it is unclear how many active Alu copies exist in the human genome and which Alu subfamilies harbor such copies. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of Alu copies across the human genome. We cloned Alu copies from a variety of genomic locations and tested these copies in a plasmid-based mobilization assay. We show that functionally intact core Alu elements are highly abundant and far outnumber all other active transposons in humans. A range of Alu lineages were found to harbor such copies, including all modern AluY subfamilies and most AluS subfamilies. We also identified two major determinants of Alu activity: (1) The primary sequence of a given Alu copy, and (2) the ability of the encoded RNA to interact with SRP9/14 to form RNA/protein (RNP) complexes. We conclude that Alu elements pose the largest transposon-based mutagenic threat to the human genome. On the basis of our data, we have begun to identify Alu copies that are likely to produce genetic variation and diseases in humans. {\textcopyright}2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

L1 elements have a long evolutionary history dating to the beginnings of eukaryotic existence. Although many aspects of their retrotransposition mechanism remain poorly understood, they likely integrate into genomic DNA by a process called target primed reverse transcription. L1s have shaped mammalian genomes through a number of mechanisms. First, they have greatly expanded the genome both by their own retrotransposition and by providing the machinery necessary for the retrotransposition of other mobile elements, such as Alus. Second, they have shuffled non-L1 sequence throughout the genome by a process termed transduction. Third, they have affected gene expression by a number of mechanisms. For instance, they occasionally insert into genes and cause disease both in humans and in mice. L1 elements have proven useful as phylogenetic markers and may find other practical applications in gene discovery following insertional mutagenesis in mice and in the delivery of therapeutic genes.},

Sequence data also provided molecular signatures for taxa from genus to class level in the SSU rRNA secondary structure, revealed by a novel approach (search for non-homoplasious synapomorphies) and used for taxonomic diagnoses. Photosynthetic euglenoids and secondary heterotrophs formed a clade, designated as Euglenophyceae (emend.) with two orders: Euglenales and Eutreptiales. The mostly marine Eutreptiales (Eutreptia, Eutreptiella; not Distigma) comprised taxa with two or four emergent flagella (the quadriflagellate Tetreutreptia was integrated within Eutreptiella). The Euglenales (freshwater genera with {\textless} or = one emergent flagellum) formed nine clades and two individual branches (single strains); however, only two clades were congruent with traditional genera: Trachelomonas (incl. Strombomonas) and Colacium. Euglena was polyphyletic and diverged into four independent clades (intermixed with Astasia, Khawkinea and Lepocinclis) and two individual branches (e.g. E. polymorpha). Phacus was also subdivided into Phacus s. str. and two combined lineages (mixed with Lepocinclis spp. or Cryptoglena). In consequence, Euglena (s. str.), Phacus and other genera were emended and one lineage (mixed Phacus/Lepocinclis-clade) was recognized as the previously neglected genus Monomorphina Mereschkowsky (1877). The sister clade of Phacus s. str. (mixed Euglena/Lepocinclis-clade) was identified as Lepocinclis Perty (emended).},

abstract = {A DNA barcode is a preferrably short and highly variable region of DNA supposed to facilitate a rapid identification of species. In many protistan lineages, a lack of species-specific morphological characters hampers an identification of species by light or electron microscopy, and difficulties to perform mating experiments in laboratory cultures also do not allow for an identification of biological species. Thus, testing candidate barcode markers as well as establishment of accurately working species identification systems are more challenging than in multicellular organisms. In cryptic species complexes the performance of a potential barcode marker can not be monitored using morphological characters as a feedback, but an inappropriate choice of DNA region may result in artifactual species trees for several reasons. Therefore a priori knowledge of the systematics of a group is required. In addition to identification of known species, methods for an automatic delimitation of species with DNA barcodes have been proposed. The Cryptophyceae provide a mixture of systematically well characterized as well as badly characterized groups and are used in this study to test the suitability of some of the methods for protists. As species identification method the performance of blast in searches against badly to well-sampled reference databases has been tested with COI-5P and 5'-partial LSU rDNA (domains A to D of the nuclear LSU rRNA gene). In addition the performance of two different methods for automatic species delimitation, fixed thresholds of genetic divergence and the general mixed Yule-coalescent model (GMYC), have been examined. The study demonstrates some pitfalls of barcoding methods that have to be taken care of. Also a best-practice approach towards establishing a DNA barcode system in protists is proposed.},

@article{Criss2001,
abstract = {Salmonella typhimurium elicits an acute inflammatory response in the host intestinal epithelium, characterized by the movement of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) across the epithelial monolayer to the intestinal lumen. It was recently shown that SipA, a protein secreted by S. typhimurium, is necessary and sufficient to drive PMN transmigration across model intestinal epithelia (Lee, C. A., Silva, M., Siber, A. M., Kelly, A. J., Galyov, E., and McCormick, B. A. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97, 12283-12288). However, the epithelial factors responsible for this process have not been identified. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that S. typhimurium-induced PMN transmigration across Madin-Darby canine kidney-polarized monolayers is regulated by the GTPase ARF6. Apically added S. typhimurium promoted the translocation of ARF6 and its exchange factor ARNO to the apical surface. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF6 inhibited Salmonella-induced PMN transmigration, which was due to a reduction in apical release of the PMN chemoattractant PEEC (pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant), without affecting bacterial internalization. Furthermore, ARF6 and its effector phospholipase D (PLD) were both required for bacteria-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to membranes. These results describe a novel signal transduction pathway, in which Salmonella initiates an ARF6- and PLD-dependent lipid signaling cascade that, in turn, directs activation of PKC, release of PEEC, and subsequent transepithelial PMN movement.},

abstract = {There are remarkable disparities among patients of different races with prostate cancer; however, the mechanism underlying this difference remains unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive landscape of the transcriptome profiles of 14 primary prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts from the Chinese population using RNA-seq, revealing tremendous diversity across prostate cancer transcriptomes with respect to gene fusions, long noncoding RNAs (long ncRNA), alternative splicing and somatic mutations. Three of the 14 tumors (21.4{\%}) harbored a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and the low prevalence of this fusion in Chinese patients was further confirmed in an additional tumor set (10/54=18.5{\%}). Notably, two novel gene fusions, CTAGE5-KHDRBS3 (20/54=37{\%}) and USP9Y-TTTY15 (19/54=35.2{\%}), occurred frequently in our patient cohort. Further systematic transcriptional profiling identified numerous long ncRNAs that were differentially expressed in the tumors. An analysis of the correlation between expression of long ncRNA and genes suggested that long ncRNAs may have functions beyond transcriptional regulation. This study yielded new insights into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer in the Chinese population.},

abstract = {The presence of 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C) in tRNA and rRNA molecules of a wide variety of organisms was first observed more than 40 years ago. However, detection of this modification was limited to specific, abundant, RNA species, due to the usage of low-throughput methods. To obtain a high resolution, systematic, and comprehensive transcriptome-wide overview of m(5)C across the three domains of life, we used bisulfite treatment on total RNA from both gram positive (B. subtilis) and gram negative (E. coli) bacteria, an archaeon (S. solfataricus) and a eukaryote (S. cerevisiae), followed by massively parallel sequencing. We were able to recover most previously documented m(5)C sites on rRNA in the four organisms, and identified several novel sites in yeast and archaeal rRNAs. Our analyses also allowed quantification of methylated m(5)C positions in 64 tRNAs in yeast and archaea, revealing stoichiometric differences between the methylation patterns of these organisms. Molecules of tRNAs in which m(5)C was absent were also discovered. Intriguingly, we detected m(5)C sites within archaeal mRNAs, and identified a consensus motif of AUCGANGU that directs methylation in S. solfataricus. Our results, which were validated using m(5)C-specific RNA immunoprecipitation, provide the first evidence for mRNA modifications in archaea, suggesting that this mode of post-transcriptional regulation extends beyond the eukaryotic domain.},

abstract = {Despite conservation of the signal recognition particle (SRP) from bacteria to man, computational approaches have failed to identify SRP components from genomes of many lower eukaryotes, raising the possibility that they have been lost or altered in those lineages. We report purification and analysis of SRP in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, providing the first description of SRP in basidiomycetous yeast. The C. neoformans SRP RNA displays a predicted structure in which the universally conserved helix 8 contains an unprecedented stem-loop insertion. Guided by this sequence, we computationally identified 152 SRP RNAs throughout the phylum Basidiomycota. This analysis revealed additional helix 8 alterations including single and double stem-loop insertions as well as loop diminutions affecting RNA structural elements that are otherwise conserved from bacteria to man. Strikingly, these SRP RNA features in Basidiomycota are accompanied by phylum-specific alterations in the RNA-binding domain of Srp54, the SRP protein subunit that directly interacts with helix 8. Our findings reveal unexpected fungal SRP diversity and suggest coevolution of the two most conserved SRP features-SRP RNA helix 8 and Srp54-in basidiomycetes. Because members of this phylum include important human and plant pathogens, these noncanonical features provide new targets for antifungal compound development. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2015.

Semi-supervised training is a means for reducing the effort needed to prepare the training set by training the model with a small number of fully labeled examples and an additional set of unlabeled or weakly labeled examples. In this work we present a semi-supervised approach to training object detection systems based on self-training. We implement our approach as a wrapper around the training process of an existing object detector and present empirical results. The key contributions of this empirical study is to demonstrate that a model trained in this manner can achieve results comparable to a model trained in the traditional manner using a much larger set of fully labeled data, and that a training data selection metric that is defined independently of the detector greatly outperforms a selection metric based on the detection confidence generated by the detector.},

It provides cells with the opportunity to create protein isoforms of differing, even opposing, functions from a single gene. Cancer cells often take advantage of this flexibility to produce proteins that promote growth and survival. Many of the isoforms produced in this manner are developmentally regulated and are preferentially re-expressed in tumors.

The review considers the distribution of MEs from different classes in various genomes, individual chromosomes, and chromatin types. There is ample evidence for an important role of MEs in the regulation of cell genes and evolution of complex eukaryotic genomes.

Early stages of human tumorigenesis are hidden from view. Here, we develop a method for inferring some aspects of the order of mutational events during tumorigenesis based on genome sequencing data for a set of tumors. This method does not assume that the sequence of driver alterations is the same for each tumor, but enables the degree of similarity or difference in the sequence to be evaluated. RESULTS: To evaluate the new method, we applied it to colon cancer tumor sequencing data and the results are consistent with the multi-step tumorigenesis model previously developed based on comparing stages of cancer. We then applied the new method to DNA sequencing data for a set of lung cancers. The model may be a useful tool for better understanding the process of tumorigenesis.

abstract = {The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement defines a distinct molecular subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the excellent initial efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with ALK+ lung cancer, resistance occurs almost inevitably. To date, there is no reliable biomarker allowing the identification of patients at higher risk of relapse. Here, we analysed a subset of 53 ALK+ tumours with and without TP53 mutation and ALK+ NSCLC cell lines by NanoString nCounter technology. We found that the co-occurrence of early TP53 mutations in ALK+ NSCLC can lead to chromosomal instability: 24{\%} of TP53-mutated patients showed amplifications of known cancer genes such as MYC (14{\%}), CCND1 (10{\%}), TERT (5{\%}), BIRC2 (5{\%}), ORAOV1 (5{\%}) and YAP1 (5{\%}). MYC-overexpressing ALK+ TP53-mutated cells had a proliferative advantage compared to wild-type cells. ChIP-Seq data revealed MYC-binding sites within the promoter region of EML4 and MYC overexpression in ALK+ TP53-mutated cells resulted in an upregulation of EML4-ALK, indicating a potential MYC-dependent resistance mechanism in patients with increased MYC copy number. Our study reveals that ALK+ NSCLC represents a more heterogeneous subgroup of tumours than initially thought, and that TP53 mutations in that particular cancer type define a subset of tumours that harbour chromosomal instability, leading to the co-occurrence of pathogenic aberrations.

abstract = {Short interspersed elements (SINEs) may be found in the genomes of a wide variety of mammals (Deininger and Batzer 1993). The Alu family of SINEs is one of the most successful mobile genetic elements, having arisen to a copy number in excess of 500,000 within the human genome in approximately 65 million years of primate evolution. (For reviews see Deininger 1989; Okada 1991; Schmid and Maraia 1992; Deininger and Batzer 1993.) Alu sequences are thought to be ancestrally derived from the 7SL RNA gene (Ullu et al. 1982) and to mobilize through an RNA polymerase III-derived transcript in a process termed retroposition (Rogers 1983). Alu sequences within the human genome can be divided into subfamilies of related elements based upon diagnostic mutations shared by subfamily members. Several groups have independently identified a series of overlapping subfamilies of Alu repeats (Slagel et al.},

abstract = {As a consequence of the accumulation of insertion events over evolutionary time, mobile elements now comprise nearly half of the human genome. The Alu, L1, and SVA mobile element families are still duplicating, generating variation between individual genomes. Mobile element insertions (MEI) have been identified as causes for genetic diseases, including hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, and various cancers. Here we present a comprehensive map of 7,380 MEI polymorphisms from the 1000 Genomes Project whole-genome sequencing data of 185 samples in three major populations detected with two detection methods. This catalog enables us to systematically study mutation rates, population segregation, genomic distribution, and functional properties of MEI polymorphisms and to compare MEI to SNP variation from the same individuals. Population allele frequencies of MEI and SNPs are described, broadly, by the same neutral ancestral processes despite vastly different mutation mechanisms and rates, except in coding regions where MEI are virtually absent, presumably due to strong negative selection. A direct comparison of MEI and SNP diversity levels suggests a differential mobile element insertion rate among populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Stewart et al.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease in terms of both underlying genetic lesions and response to therapeutic treatments. We performed deep whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing on 19 lung cancer cell lines and three lung tumor/normal pairs. Overall, our data show that cell line models exhibit similar mutation spectra to human tumor samples. Smoker and never-smoker cancer samples exhibit distinguishable patterns of mutations. A number of epigenetic regulators, including KDM6A, ASH1L, SMARCA4, and ATAD2, are frequently altered by mutations or copy number changes. A systematic survey of splice-site mutations identified 106 splice site mutations associated with cancer specific aberrant splicing, including mutations in several known cancer-related genes. RAC1b, an isoform of the RAC1 GTPase that includes one additional exon, was found to be preferentially up-regulated in lung cancer. We further show that its expression is significantly associated with sensitivity to a MAP2K (MEK) inhibitor PD-0325901. Taken together, these data present a comprehensive genomic landscape of a large number of lung cancer samples and further demonstrate that cancer-specific alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon that has potential utility as therapeutic biomarkers. The detailed characterizations of the lung cancer cell lines also provide genomic context to the vast amount of experimental data gathered for these lines over the decades, and represent highly valuable resources for cancer biology.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: •

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The Cactaceae are a major New World plant family and popular in horticulture. Still, taxonomic units and species limits have been difficult to define, and molecular phylogenetic studies so far have yielded largely unresolved trees, so relationships within Cactaceae remain insufficiently understood. This study focuses on the predominantly epiphytic tribe Rhipsalideae and evaluates the utility of a spectrum of plastid genomic regions. •

METHODS: We present a phylogenetic study including 52 of the 53 Rhipsalideae species and all the infraspecific taxa. Seven regions (trnK intron, matK, rbcL, rps3-rpl16, rpl16 intron, psbA-trnH, trnQ-rps16), ca. 5600 nucleotides (nt) were sequenced per sample. The regions used were evaluated for their phylogenetic performance and performance in DNA-based species recognition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined beforehand. •

KEY RESULTS: The Rhipsalideae are monophyletic and contain five clades that correspond to the genera Rhipsalis, Lepismium, Schlumbergera, Hatiora, and Rhipsalidopsis. The species-level tree was well resolved and supported; the rpl16 and trnK introns yielded the best phylogenetic signal. Although the psbA-trnH and trnQ-rps16 spacers were the most successful individual regions for OTU identification, their success rate did not significantly exceed 70{\%}. The highest OTU identification rate of 97{\%} was found using the combination of psbA-trnH, rps3-rpl16, trnK intron, and trnQ-rps16 as a minimum possible marker length (ca. 1660 nt). •

CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic performance of a marker is not determined by the level of sequence variability, and species discrimination power does not necessarily correlate with phylogenetic utility.},

Shotgun sequencing is a well-established biological and computational method used in practice. Many conventional algorithms for shotgun sequencing are based on the notion of pairwise fragment overlap. While shotgun sequencing infers a DNA sequence given the sequences of overlapping fragments, a recent and complementary method, called sequencing by hybridization (SBH), infers a DNA sequence given the set of oligomers that represents all subwords of some fixed length, k. In this paper, we propose a new computer algorithm for DNA sequence assembly that combines in a novel way the techniques of both shotgun and SBH methods. Based on our preliminary investigations, the algorithm promises to be very fast and practical for DNA sequence assembly.},

This analysis led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of RNA polymerase (Pol) III from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three lines of evidence show that UK-118005 inhibits cell growth by targeting RNA Pol III in yeast. First, a dominant mutation in the g domain of Rpo31p, the largest subunit of RNA Pol III, confers resistance to the compound. Second, UK-118005 rapidly inhibits tRNA synthesis in wild-type cells but not in UK-118005 resistant mutants. Third, in biochemical assays, UK-118005 inhibits tRNA gene transcription in vitro by the wild-type but not the mutant Pol III enzyme. By testing analogs of UK-118005 in a template-specific RNA Pol III transcription assay, an inhibitor with significantly higher potency, ML-60218, was identified. Further examination showed that both compounds are broad-spectrum inhibitors, displaying activity against RNA Pol III transcription systems derived from Candida albicans and human cells. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrates that RNA Pol III can be targeted by small synthetic molecules.},

abstract = {Long interspersed element-1 (L1) is an autonomous retroelement that is active in the human genome. The proposed mechanism of insertion for L1 suggests that cleavage of both strands of genomic DNA is required. We demonstrate that L1 expression leads to a high level of double-strand break (DSB) formation in DNA using immunolocalization of $\gamma$-H2AX foci and the COMET assay. Similar to its role in mediating DSB repair in response to radiation, ATM is required for L1-induced $\gamma$-H2AX foci and for L1 retrotransposition. This is the first characterization of a DNA repair response from expression of a non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon in mammalian cells as well as the first demonstration that a host DNA repair gene is required for successful integration. Notably, the number of L1-induced DSBs is greater than the predicted numbers of successful insertions, suggesting a significant degree of inefficiency during the integration process. This result suggests that the endonuclease activity of endogenously expressed L1 elements could contribute to DSB formation in germ-line and somatic tissues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a widely used approach to study protein-DNA interactions. Often, the quantities of interest are the differential occupancies relative to controls, between genetic backgrounds, treatments, or combinations thereof. Current methods for differential occupancy of ChIP-Seq data rely however on binning or sliding window techniques, for which the choice of the window and bin sizes are subjective. Results: Here, we present GenoGAM (Genome-wide Generalized Additive Model), which brings the well-established and flexible generalized additive models framework to genomic applications using a data parallelism strategy. We model ChIP-Seq read count frequencies as products of smooth functions along chromosomes. Smoothing parameters are objectively estimated from the data by crossvalidation, eliminating ad hoc binning and windowing needed by current approaches. GenoGAM provides base-level and region-level significance testing for full factorial designs. Application to a ChIP-Seq dataset in yeast showed increased sensitivity over existing differential occupancy methods while controlling for type I error rate. By analyzing a set of DNA methylation data and illustrating an extension to a peak caller, we further demonstrate the potential of GenoGAM as a generic statistical modeling tool for genome-wide assays.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder-Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

abstract = {Chromophyte algae differ fundamentally from plants in possessing chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll c and that have a more complex bounding-membrane topology. Although chromophytes are known to be evolutionary chimaeras of a red alga and a non-photosynthetic host, which gave rise to their exceptional membrane complexity, their cell biology is poorly understood. Cryptomonads are the only chromophytes that still retain the enslaved red algal nucleus as a minute nucleomorph. Here we report complete sequences for all three nucleomorph chromosomes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. This tiny 551-kilobase eukaryotic genome is the most gene-dense known, with only 17 diminutive spliceosomal introns and 44 overlapping genes. Marked evolutionary compaction hundreds of millions of years ago eliminated nearly all the nucleomorph genes for metabolic functions, but left 30 for chloroplast-located proteins. To allow expression of these proteins, nucleomorphs retain hundreds of genetic-housekeeping genes. Nucleomorph DNA replication and periplastid protein synthesis require the import of many nuclear gene products across endoplasmic reticulum and periplastid membranes. The chromosomes have centromeres, but possibly only one loop domain, offering a means for studying eukaryotic chromosome replication, segregation and evolution.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.},

@article{An2004,
abstract = {Background: A significant portion (about 8{\%} in the human genome) of mammalian mRNA sequences contains AU (Adenine and Uracil) rich elements or AREs at their 3′ untranslated regions (UTR). These mRNA sequences are usually stable. However, an increasing number of observations have been made of unstable species, possibly depending on certain elements such as Alu repeats. ARE motifs are repeats of the tetramer AUUU and a monomer A at the end of the repeats ((AUUU)nA). The importance of AREs in biology is that they make certain mRNA unstable. Protooncogene, such as c-fos, c-myc, and c-jun in humans, are associated with AREs. Although it has been known that the increased number of ARE motifs caused the decrease of the half-life of mRNA containing ARE repeats, the exact mechanism is as of yet unknown. We analyzed the occurrences of AREs and Alu and propose a possible mechanism for how human mRNA could acquire and keep AREs at its 3′ UTR originating from Alu repeats. Results: Interspersed in the human genome, Alu repeats occupy 5{\%} of the 3′ UTR of mRNA sequences. Alu has poly-adenine (poly-A) regions at its end, which lead to poly-thymine (poly-T) regions at the end of its complementary Alu. It has been found that AREs are present at the poly-T regions. From the 3′ UTR of the NCBI's reference mRNA sequence database, we found nearly 40{\%} (38.5{\%}) of ARE (Class I) were associated with Alu sequences (Table 1) within one mismatch allowance in ARE sequences. Other ARE classes had statistically significant associations as well. This is far from a random occurrence given their limited quantity. At each ARE class, random distribution was simulated 1,000 times, and it was shown that there is a special relationship between ARE patterns and the Alu repeats. Conclusion: AREs are mediating sequence elements affecting the stabilization or degradation of mRNA at the 3′ untranslated regions. However, AREs' mechanism and origins are unknown. We report that Alu is a source of ARE. We found that half of the longest AREs were derived from the poly-T regions of the complementary Alu. {\textcopyright} 2004 Jun An et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {More than 100 distinct chemical modifications to RNA have been characterized to date. They are present in abun-dant noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)—including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA)—and are important for maintaining the proper functions of ncRNAs in translation and splicing. Several modifications, including N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), 5-methylcytidine (m 5 C), inosine (I), pseudouri-dine (Y), N 1 -methyladenosine (m 1 A) and 5-hydroxyl-methylcytidine (hm 5 C), are found internally in eukaryotic mRNA and can influence the metabolism and function of mRNA 1 (Fig. 1). Thus, the multitude of RNA modifica-tions together were first designated 'RNA epigenetics' in 2010 (ref. 2), and the term 'epitranscriptome' was coined in 2012 (ref. 3) in analogy to epigenetic regulation medi-ated by modifications to DNA and histone. However, functional studies of the epitranscriptome lagged behind those of the epigenome on account of the lack of sensitive and robust sequencing technologies that could detect these epitranscriptomic marks in a tran-scriptome-wide manner. Several major challenges exist for mapping the epitranscriptome. First, the majority of RNA modifications cannot be directly detected by high-throughput sequencing. Because chemical modifications to RNA often do not change the base pairing properties of the modified bases, reverse transcription (RT) will simply erase these modifications and render them indistinguish-able from the regular RNA bases. Second, while rRNA, tRNA and snRNA are abundant, other types of cellular RNA—for instance, mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)—can be of low abundance. Third, there is a lack of existing computational tools to facilitate the identifica-tion of modification sites from sequencing data. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed major advances in the development of novel transcriptome-wide sequencing technologies for distinct epitranscrip-tomic marks.

abstract = {Background: Accurate and automated phenotyping of leaf images is necessary for high throughput studies of leaf form like genome-wide association analysis and other forms of quantitative trait locus mapping. Dissected leaves (also referred to as compound) that are subdivided into individual units are an attractive system to study diversification of form. However, there are only few software tools for their automated analysis. Thus, high-throughput image processing algorithms are needed that can partition these leaves in their phenotypically relevant units and calculate morphological features based on these units. Results: We have developed MowJoe, an image processing algorithm that dissects a dissected leaf into leaflets, petiolule, rachis and petioles. It employs image skeletonization to convert leaves into graphs, and thereafter applies algorithms operating on graph structures. This partitioning of a leaf allows the derivation of morphological features such as leaf size, or eccentricity of leaflets. Furthermore, MowJoe automatically places landmarks onto the terminal leaflet that can be used for further leaf shape analysis. It generates specific output files that can directly be imported into downstream shape analysis tools. We applied the algorithm to two accessions of Cardamine hirsuta and show that our features are able to robustly discriminate between these accessions. Conclusion: MowJoe is a tool for the semi-automated, quantitative high throughput shape analysis of dissected leaf images. It provides the statistical power for the detection of the genetic basis of quantitative morphological variations.},

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance decomposition.},

abstract = {Since the first usage of antimicrobials, the burden of resistance among bacteria has progressively increased and has accelerated within the last 10 years. Antibiotic resistance genes were present at very low levels prior to the introduction of antibiotics and it is largely the selective pressure of antibiotic use and the resulting exposure of bacteria, not only in humans but also in companion and food animals and the environment, which has caused the rise. The increasing mobility across the globe of people, food and animals is another factor. Examples of this are the international pandemic of different genotypes of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (particularly CTX-M-14 and -15) and the emergence of the carbapenemase KPC-1 in both the USA and Israel. This review details examples of both the emergence and dissemination through different genetic routes, both direct and indirect selective pressure, of significance resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas/Acinetobacter. The response made by society to reduce resistance involves surveillance, reduced usage, improved infection control and the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. Although efforts are being made in all these areas, there is an urgent need to increase the effectiveness of these interventions or some bacterial infections will become difficult if not impossible to treat reliably.},

abstract = {RNA annotation and mapping of promoters for analysis of gene expression (RAMPAGE) is a method that harnesses highly specific sequencing of 5'-complete complementary DNAs to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) genome-wide. Although TSS mapping has historically relied on detection of 5'-complete cDNAs, current genome-wide approaches typically have limited specificity and provide only scarce information regarding transcript structure. RAMPAGE allows for highly stringent selection of 5'-complete molecules, thus allowing base-resolution TSS identification with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Paired-end sequencing of medium-length cDNAs yields transcript structure information that is essential to interpreting the relationship of TSSs to annotated genes and transcripts. As opposed to standard RNA-seq, RAMPAGE explicitly yields accurate and highly reproducible expression level estimates for individual promoters. Moreover, this approach offers a streamlined 2-to 3-day protocol that is optimized for extensive sample multiplexing, and is therefore adapted for large-scale projects. This method has been applied successfully to human and Drosophila samples, and in principle should be applicable to any eukaryotic system. {\textcopyright} 2013 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Inosine is an abundant RNA modification in the human transcriptome and is essential for many biological processes in modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines to inosines (A-to-I editing) in double-stranded regions. We previously established a biochemical method called "inosine chemical erasing" (ICE) to directly identify inosines on RNA strands with high reliability. Here, we have applied the ICE method combined with deep sequencing (ICE-seq) to conduct an unbiased genome-wide screening of A-to-I editing sites in the transcriptome of human adult brain. Taken together with the sites identified by the conventional ICE method, we mapped 19,791 novel sites and newly found 1258 edited mRNAs, including 66 novel sites in coding regions, 41 of which cause altered amino acid assignment. ICE-seq detected novel editing sites in various repeat elements as well as in short hairpins. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these edited mRNAs are associated with transcription, energy metabolism, and neurological disorders, providing new insights into various aspects of human brain functions.},

In this study, we constructed a splicing array to examine approximately 1,500 mRNA isoforms from a panel of genes previously implicated in prostate cancer and identified a large number of cell type-specific mRNA isoforms. We also developed a novel "two-dimensional" profiling strategy to simultaneously quantify changes in splicing and transcript abundance; the results revealed extensive covariation between transcription and splicing in prostate cancer cells. Taking advantage of the ability of our technology to analyze RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, we derived a specific set of mRNA isoform biomarkers for prostate cancer using independent panels of tissue samples for feature selection and cross-analysis. A number of cancer-specific splicing switch events were further validated by laser capture microdissection. Quantitative changes in transcription/RNA stability and qualitative differences in splicing ratio may thus be combined to characterize tumorigenic programs and signature mRNA isoforms may serve as unique biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and prognosis.},

abstract = {RNA levels in a cell are determined by the relative rates of RNA synthesis and decay. State-of-the-art transcriptional analyses only employ total cellular RNA. Therefore, changes in RNA levels cannot be attributed to RNA synthesis or decay, and temporal resolution is poor. Recently, it was reported that newly transcribed RNA can be biosynthetically labeled for 1-2 h using thiolated nucleosides, purified from total cellular RNA and subjected to microarray analysis. However, in order to study signaling events at molecular level, analysis of changes occurring within minutes is required. We developed an improved approach to separate total cellular RNA into newly transcribed and preexisting RNA following 10-15 min of metabolic labeling. Employing new computational tools for array normalization and half-life determination we simultaneously study short-term RNA synthesis and decay as well as their impact on cellular transcript levels. As an example we studied the response of fibroblasts to type I and II interferons (IFN). Analysis of RNA transcribed within 15-30 min at different times during the first three hours of interferon-receptor activation resulted in a {\textgreater}10-fold increase in microarray sensitivity and provided a comprehensive profile of the kinetics of IFN-mediated changes in gene expression. We identify a previously undisclosed highly connected network of short-lived transcripts selectively down-regulated by IFN$\gamma$ in between 30 and 60 min after IFN treatment showing strong associations with cell cycle and apoptosis, indicating novel mechanisms by which IFN$\gamma$ affects these pathways.

It is a challenge to disentangle processes occurring on complementary strands of the same genomic region. We present the double-stranded HMM (dsHMM), a model for the strand-specific analysis of genomic processes. We applied dsHMM to yeast using strand specific transcription data, nucleosome data, and protein binding data for a set of 11 factors associated with the regulation of transcription.The resulting annotation recovers the mRNA transcription cycle (initiation, elongation, termination) while correctly predicting strand-specificity and directionality of the transcription process. We find that pre-initiation complex formation is an essentially undirected process, giving rise to a large number of bidirectional promoters and to pervasive antisense transcription. Notably, 12{\%} of all transcriptionally active positions showed simultaneous activity on both strands. Furthermore, dsHMM reveals that antisense transcription is specifically suppressed by Nrd1, a yeast termination factor.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, molecular phylogenetic data have allowed evaluations of hypotheses on the evolution of green algae based on vegetative morphological and ultrastructural characters. Higher taxa are now generally recognized on the basis of ultrastructural characters. Molecular analyses have mostly employed primarily nuclear small subunit rDNA (18S) and plastid rbcL data, as well as data on intron gain, complete genome sequencing, and mitochondrial sequences. Molecular-based revisions of classification at nearly all levels have occurred, from dismemberment of long-established genera and families into multiple classes, to the circumscription of two major lineages within the green algae. One lineage, the chlorophyte algae or Chlorophyta sensu stricto, comprises most of what are commonly called green algae and includes most members of the grade of putatively ancestral scaly flagellates in Prasinophyceae plus members of Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Chlorophyceae. The other lineage (charophyte algae and embryophyte land plants), comprises at least five monophyletic groups of green algae, plus embryophytes. A recent multigene analysis corroborates a close relationship between Mesostigma (formerly in the Prasinophyceae) and the charophyte algae, although sequence data of the Mesostigma mitochondrial genome analysis places the genus as sister to charophyte and chlorophyte algae. These studies also support Charales as sister to land plants. The reorganization of taxa stimulated by molecular analyses is expected to continue as more data accumulate and new taxa and habitats are sampled.},

abstract = {N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate. Current mapping approaches localize m6A residues to transcript regions 100-200 nt long but cannot identify precise m6A positions on a transcriptome-wide level. Here we developed m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) and used it to demonstrate that antibodies to m6A can induce specific mutational signatures at m6A residues after ultraviolet light-induced antibody-RNA cross-linking and reverse transcription. We found that these antibodies similarly induced mutational signatures at N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a modification found at the first nucleotide of certain mRNAs. Using these signatures, we mapped m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and mouse mRNA and identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a new class of m6A-containing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).},

Accurate maps of promoters and enhancers are required for understanding transcriptional regulation. Promoters and enhancers are usually mapped by integration of chromatin assays charting histone modifications, DNA accessibility, and transcription factor binding. However, current algorithms are limited by unrealistic data distribution assumptions. Here we propose GenoSTAN (Genomic STate ANnotation), a hidden Markov model overcoming these limitations. We map promoters and enhancers for 127 cell types and tissues from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, today's largest compendium of chromatin assays. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GenoSTAN generally identifies promoters and enhancers with significantly higher accuracy than previous methods. Moreover, Geno- STAN-derived promoters and enhancers showed significantly higher enrichment of complex trait-Associated genetic variants than current annotations. Altogether, GenoSTAN provides an easy-To-use tool to define promoters and enhancers in any system, and our annotation of human transcriptional cis-regulatory elements constitutes a rich resource for future research in biology and medicine.},

Gene expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing reveals qualitative and quantitative changes in RNA species at steady state but obscures the intracellular dynamics of RNA transcription, processing and decay. We developed thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM seq), an orthogonal-chemistry-based RNA sequencing technology that detects 4-thiouridine (s 4 U) incorporation in RNA species at single-nucleotide resolution. In combination with well-established metabolic RNA labeling protocols and coupled to standard, low-input, high-throughput RNA sequencing methods, SLAM seq enabled rapid access to RNA-polymerase-II-dependent gene expression dynamics in the context of total RNA. We validated the method in mouse embryonic stem cells by showing that the RNA-polymerase-II-dependent transcriptional output scaled with Oct4/Sox2/Nanog-defined enhancer activity, and we provide quantitative and mechanistic evidence for transcript-specific RNA turnover mediated by post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways initiated by microRNAs and N 6 -methyladenosine.

abstract = {Covalent modifications of nucleic acids play an important role in regulating their functions. Among these modifications, (cytosine-5) DNA methylation is best known for its role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Post-transcriptional RNA modification is a characteristic feature of noncoding RNAs, and has been described for rRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs. (Cytosine-5) RNA methylation has been detected in stable and long-lived RNA molecules, but its function is still unclear, mainly due to technical limitations. In order to facilitate the analysis of RNA methylation patterns we have established a protocol for the chemical deamination of cytosines in RNA, followed by PCR-based amplification of cDNA and DNA sequencing. Using tRNAs and rRNAs as examples we show that cytosine methylation can be reproducibly and quantitatively detected by bisulfite sequencing. The combination of this method with deep sequencing allowed the analysis of a large number of RNA molecules. These results establish a versatile method for the identification and characterization of RNA methylation patterns, which will be useful for defining the biological function of RNA methylation. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

However, there is no existing software that can simulate Illumina reads with real error and quality distributions and coverage bias yet, which is very useful in relevant software development and study designing of sequencing projects. Results: We provide a software package, pIRS (profile-based Illumina pair-end reads simulator), which simulates Illumina reads with empirical Base-Calling and GC{\%}-depth profiles trained from real re-sequencing data. The error and quality distributions as well as coverage bias patterns of simulated reads using pIRS fit the properties of real sequencing data better than existing simulators. In addition, pIRS also comes with a tool to simulate the heterozygous diploid genomes. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zander2016,
abstract = {Cells grow well only in a narrow range of physiological conditions. Surviving extreme conditions requires the instantaneous expression of chaperones that help to overcome stressful situations. To ensure the preferential synthesis of these heat-shock proteins, cells inhibit transcription, pre-mRNA processing and nuclear export of non-heat-shock transcripts, while stress-specific mRNAs are exclusively exported and translated. How cells manage the selective retention of regular transcripts and the simultaneous rapid export of heat-shock mRNAs is largely unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shuttling RNA adaptor proteins Npl3, Gbp2, Hrb1 and Nab2 are loaded co-transcriptionally onto growing pre-mRNAs. For nuclear export, they recruit the export-receptor heterodimer Mex67-Mtr2 (TAP-p15 in humans). Here we show that cellular stress induces the dissociation of Mex67 and its adaptor proteins from regular mRNAs to prevent general mRNA export. At the same time, heat-shock mRNAs are rapidly exported in association with Mex67, without the need for adapters. The immediate co-transcriptional loading of Mex67 onto heat-shock mRNAs involves Hsf1, a heat-shock transcription factor that binds to heat-shock-promoter elements in stress-responsive genes. An important difference between the export modes is that adaptor-protein-bound mRNAs undergo quality control, whereas stress-specific transcripts do not. In fact, regular mRNAs are converted into uncontrolled stress-responsive transcripts if expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter, suggesting that whether an mRNA undergoes quality control is encrypted therein. Under normal conditions, Mex67 adaptor proteins are recruited for RNA surveillance, with only quality-controlled mRNAs allowed to associate with Mex67 and leave the nucleus. Thus, at the cost of error-free mRNA formation, heat-shock mRNAs are exported and translated without delay, allowing cells to survive extreme situations.},

Conflicts or congruence between multigene and single-gene phylogenies, as well as the assumed superiority of the multigene approach, are often difficult to assess solely because of incongruent taxon sampling. In the present study, a data set of 43 nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA and plastid-encoded rbcL gene sequences was generated from the same strains of conjugating green algae (Zygnematophyceae, Streptophyta). Phylogenetic analyses used the genes individually and in combination, either as concatenated sequences or with the log-likelihood summation method. Single-gene analyses, although mostly congruent, revealed some conflicting nodes and showed different patterns of statistical support. Combined analyses confidently resolved the conflicts between the single-gene analyses, enhanced phylogenetic resolution, and were better supported by morphological information. Long-branch taxa were not the same for the two genes analyzed, and, thus, their effect on phylogenetic resolution was minimized in the combined analyses.},

LPS is composed of three main parts, an O-antigen, lipid A, and a core region, all of which display immense structural variations among different bacterial species. These components not only provide cell integrity but also elicit an immune response in the host, which ranges from other marine organisms to humans. Toll-like receptor 4 and its homologs are the dedicated receptors that detect LPS and trigger the immune system to respond, often causing a wide variety of inflammatory diseases and even death. This review describes the structural organization of selected LPSes and their association with economically important diseases in marine organisms. In addition, the potential therapeutic use of LPS as an immune adjuvant in different diseases is highlighted.},

However, accurately deciphering the DNA sequence from the noisy and complex electrical signal is challenging. Here, we report Chiron, the first deep learning model to achieve end-to-end basecalling: directly translating the raw signal to DNA sequence without the error-prone segmentation step. Trained with only a small set of 4000 reads, we show that our model provides state-of-the-art basecalling accuracy even on previously unseen species. Chiron achieves basecalling speeds of over 2000 bases per second using desktop computer graphics processing units.},

abstract = {Single-cell analysis has developed into a key topic in cell biology with future applications in personalized medicine, tumor identification as well as tumor discovery (Editorial, 2013). Here we employ inkjet-like printing to isolate individual living single human B cells (Raji cell line) and load them directly into standard PCR tubes. Single cells are optically detected in the nozzle of the microfluidic piezoelectric dispenser chip to ensure printing of droplets with single cells only. The printing process has been characterized by using microbeads (10µm diameter) resulting in a single bead delivery in 27 out of 28 cases and relative positional precision of ±350µm at a printing distance of 6mm between nozzle and tube lid. Process-integrated optical imaging enabled to identify the printing failure as void droplet and to exclude it from downstream processing. PCR of truly single-cell DNA was performed without pre-amplification directly from single Raji cells with 33{\%} success rate (N=197) and Cq values of 36.3±2.5. Additionally single cell whole genome amplification (WGA) was employed to pre-amplify the single-cell DNA by a factor of {\textgreater}1000. This facilitated subsequent PCR for the same gene yielding a success rate of 64{\%} (N=33) which will allow more sophisticated downstream analysis like sequencing, electrophoresis or multiplexing.},

Here, we expand the type of genetic variants detected in GWAS to include major deletions, insertions and rearrangements. We first use raw sequencing data directly to derive short sequences, k-mers, that mark a broad range of polymorphisms independently of a reference genome. We then link k-mers associated with phenotypes to specific genomic regions. Using this approach, we reanalyzed 2,000 traits in Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato and maize populations. Associations identified with k-mers recapitulate those found with SNPs, but with stronger statistical support. Importantly, we discovered new associations with structural variants and with regions missing from reference genomes. Our results demonstrate the power of performing GWAS before linking sequence reads to specific genomic regions, which allows the detection of a wider range of genetic variants responsible for phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Routine methods for assaying steady-state mRNA levels such as RNA-seq and micro-arrays are commonly used as readouts to study the role of transcription factors (TFs) in gene expression regulation. However, cellular RNA levels do not solely depend on activity of TFs and subsequent transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but are also affected by RNA turnover rate. Here, we demonstrate that integrated analysis of genome-wide TF occupancy, Pol II binding and steady-state RNA levels provide important insights in gene regulatory mechanisms. Pol II occupancy, as detected by Pol II ChIP-seq, was found to correlate better with TF occupancy compared to steady-state RNA levels and is thus a more precise readout for the primary transcriptional mechanisms that are triggered by signal transduction. Furthermore, analysis of differential Pol II occupancy and RNA-seq levels identified genes with high Pol II occupancy and relatively low RNA levels and vice versa. These categories are strongly enriched for genes from different functional classes. Our results demonstrate a complementary value in Pol II chip-seq and RNA-seq approaches for better understanding of gene expression regulation. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

Thirteen patients (3.7{\%}) had positive surveillance cultures for Trichosporon species in stool, skin, or urine. Three of the 13 patients developed systemic infections after having positive surveillance cultures. In two of these three patients, urine cultures were positive near the time of systemic infection. The route of entry appeared to have been enteric in two patients and cutaneous in one patient. Both colonizing and infecting organisms showed in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B and nystatin. This study suggests that positive surveillance cultures for Trichosporon species may correlate with systemic infection in the severely immunocompromised patient and that repeated positive urine cultures may indicate dissemination.},

Using this method, a very small number of RNA molecules per HeLa cell is found to have a distribution of 5′ ends centered on the in vitro Alu transcription start site. The distribution of these 5′ ends suggests that they are more likely the result of hnRNA degradation rather than transcription start sites.

abstract = {The effects of various stresses on mitochondrial activity and structure within the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii were investigated using the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123. Within control cells, treatment with rhodamine 123 stained an intense fluorescent network, which was considered to be mitochondrial from the similarity in structure to models of mitochondria reconstructed from serial-section electron microscopy, and because this pattern of staining was abolished following the addition of metabolic inhibitors. Following osmotic shrinkage and rehydration, fragmentation of the mitochondrial network was observed within potentially viable cells. This was reversible within 1 h of resuspension in isotonic medium. Exposure of cells to hypertonic solutions of rapidly permeating compounds did not induce similar structural alterations. These changes in the mitochondria were confirmed by thin-section electron microscopy. In the presence of higher osmolalities of non-permeating compounds, which induce a greater loss of viability, rhodamine 123 stained cells uniformly. Following the osmotic stresses induced by slow rates of freezing and subsequent thawing no fragmentation in mitochondrial staining was observed. These findings demonstrate that shrinkage and rehydration may induce alterations to the structure and function of organelles and may be factors in determining cellular viability following osmotic stress.},

abstract = {AATF is a central regulator of the cellular outcome upon p53 activation, a finding that has primarily been attributed to its function as a transcription factor. Recent data showed that AATF is essential for ribosome biogenesis and plays a role in rRNA maturation. AATF has been implicated to fulfil this role through direct interaction with rRNA and was identified in several RNA-interactome capture experiments. Here, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of the RNA bound by AATF using CLIP-sequencing. Interestingly, this approach shows predominant binding of the 45S pre-ribosomal RNA precursor molecules. Furthermore, AATF binds to mRNAs encoding for ribosome biogenesis factors as well as snoRNAs. These findings are complemented by an in-depth analysis of the protein interactome of AATF containing a large set of proteins known to play a role in rRNA maturation with an emphasis on the protein-RNA-complexes known to be required for the generation of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU). In line with this finding, the binding sites of AATF within the 45S rRNA precursor localize in close proximity to the SSU cleavage sites. Consequently, our multilayer analysis of the protein-RNA interactome of AATF reveals this protein to be an important hub for protein and RNA interactions involved in ribosome biogenesis.},

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance decomposition.},

abstract = {The effect of the modified nucleoside pseudouridine (psi) on RNA structure was compared with uridine. The extent of base stacking in model RNA oligonucleotides was measured by 1H NMR, UV, and CD spectroscopy. The UV and CD results indicate that the model single-stranded oligoribonucleotides AAUA and AA psi A form stacked structures in solution and the CD results for AA psi A are consistent with a general A-form helical conformation. The AA psi A oligomer exhibits a greater degree of UV hypochromicity over the temperature range 5-55 degrees C, consistent with a better stacked, more A-form structure compared with AAUA. The extent of stacking for each nucleotide residue was inferred from the percent 3'-endo sugar conformation as indicated by the H1'-H2' NMR scalar coupling. This indirect indication of stacking was confirmed by sequential NOE experiments. NMR measurements as a function of temperature indicate that pseudouridine forms a more stable base stacking arrangement than uridine, an effect that is propagated throughout the helix to stabilize stacking of neighboring purine nucleosides. The N1-H imino proton in AA psi A exchanges slowly with solvent, suggesting a role for the extra imino proton in stabilizing the conformation of pseudouridine. These results show that the conformational stabilization is an intrinsic property of pseudouridine occurring at the nucleotide level. The characteristics of pseudouridine in these models are consistent with earlier studies on intact rRNA, indicating that pseudouridine probably performs the same stabilizing function in most structural contexts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Defining cell type-specific transcriptomes in mammals can be challenging, especially for unannotated regions of the genome. We have developed an analytical pipeline called groHMM for annotating primary transcripts using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) data. Herein, we use this pipeline to characterize the transcriptome of an immortalized adult human ventricular cardiomyocyte cell line (AC16) in response to signaling by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$), which is controlled in part by NF-$\kappa$B, a key transcriptional regulator of inflammation. A unique aspect of this work is the use of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) inhibitor $\alpha$-amanitin, which we used to define a set of RNA polymerase I and III (Pol I and Pol III) transcripts. RESULTS Using groHMM, we identified {\~{}}30,000 coding and non-coding transcribed regions in AC16 cells, which includes a set of unique Pol I and Pol III primary transcripts. Many of these transcripts have not been annotated previously, including enhancer RNAs originating from NF-$\kappa$B binding sites. In addition, we observed that AC16 cells rapidly and dynamically reorganize their transcriptomes in response to TNF$\alpha$ stimulation in an NF-$\kappa$B-dependent manner, switching from a basal state to a proinflammatory state affecting a spectrum of cardiac-associated protein-coding and non-coding genes. Moreover, we observed distinct Pol II dynamics for up- and downregulated genes, with a rapid release of Pol II into productive elongation for TNF$\alpha$-stimulated genes. As expected, the TNF$\alpha$-induced changes in the AC16 transcriptome resulted in corresponding changes in cognate mRNA and protein levels in a similar manner, but with delayed kinetics. CONCLUSIONS Our studies illustrate how computational genomics can be used to characterize the signal-regulated transcriptome in biologically relevant cell types, providing new information about how the human genome is organized, transcribed and regulated. In addition, they show how $\alpha$-amanitin can be used to reveal the Pol I and Pol III transcriptome. Furthermore, they shed new light on the regulation of the cardiomyocyte transcriptome in response to a proinflammatory signal and help to clarify the link between inflammation and cardiomyocyte function at the transcriptional level.},

abstract = {Fungi such as Fusarium species, Trichosporon species, Curvularia species, and Alternaria species previously were thought to represent contamination or harmless colonization when isolated from immunocompromised patients. More recently, the pathogenic role of these and other fungi has been clearly established. Three diverse groups of fungi are responsible for these emerging infections: the agents of phaeohyphomycosis and hyalohyphomycosis and certain yeasts. Reports of the emergence of these organisms as significant pathogens may be ascribed to increasing awareness by physicians and microbiologists, aggressive culture of patient specimens, increasingly cytotoxic chemotherapy, and selection of resistant organisms by the widespread empirical use of amphotericin B. Infections with these fungi tend to be disseminated and are frequently fatal in immunocompromised hosts. Treatment of these infections is not standardized. Experimental therapy in murine models of fungal infections suggests a role for newer agents, combination antifungal chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Motivation: Recent imaging technologies allow for high-throughput tracking of cells as they migrate, divide, express fluorescent markers and change their morphology. The interpretation of these data requires unbiased, efficient statistical methods that model the dynamics of cell phenotypes. Results: We introduce treeHFM, a probabilistic model which generalizes the theory of hidden Markov models to tree structured data. While accounting for the entire genealogy of a cell, treeHFM categorizes cells according to their primary phenotypic features. It models all relevant events in a cell's life, including cell division, and thereby enables the analysis of event order and cell fate heterogeneity. Simulations show higher accuracy in predicting correct state labels when modeling the more complex, tree-shaped dependency of samples over standard HMM modeling. Applying treeHFM to time lapse images of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, we demonstrate that progenitor cells undergo a well-ordered sequence of differentiation events.},

abstract = {Current genomic screens for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) predict a large number of genomic regions containing potential structural ncRNAs. The analysis of these data requires highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak predictions. Existing methods struggle with these goals because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence alignments, which regularly misalign RNA structure and therefore do not support identification of structural similarities. To overcome this limitation, we compute columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on sequence and structure similarity; we refer to these structure-based alignment reliabilities as STARs. The columnwise STARs of alignments, or STAR profiles, provide a versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of ncRNAs. In particular, we improve the boundary prediction of the widely used ncRNA gene finder RNAz by a factor of 3 from a median deviation of 47 to 13 nt. Post-processing RNAz predictions, LocARNA-P's STAR score allows much stronger discrimination between true- and false-positive predictions than RNAz's own evaluation. The improved accuracy, in this scenario increased from AUC 0.71 to AUC 0.87, significantly reduces the cost of successive analysis steps. The ready-to-use software tool LocARNA-P produces structure-based multiple RNA alignments with associated columnwise STARs and predicts ncRNA boundaries. We provide additional results, a web server for LocARNA/LocARNA-P, and the software package, including documentation and a pipeline for refining screens for structural ncRNA, at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Supplements/LocARNA-P/.},

abstract = {By using a method in which cell-wall-deficient Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells were agitated in the presence of DNA, glass beads, and polyethylene glycol, nuclear transformation rates of approximately 10(3) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA were achieved. The nitrate reductase gene from wild-type Chlamydomonas was used to complement a mutation in the corresponding gene of a strain containing nit1-305. Transformants were selected by growth with nitrate as sole source of nitrogen. The transforming DNA integrated into the genome at a low-copy number in nit+ transformants. When cells carrying nit1-305 were agitated in the presence of two plasmids, one with the gene for nitrate reductase and the second with an unselected gene, the unselected gene was present in 10-50{\%} of nit+ transformants. This high frequency of cotransformation will allow any cloned gene to be introduced into Chlamydomonas. Moreover, the overall efficiency of transformation should be high enough to permit isolation of genes from genomic libraries by complementation of stable nuclear mutants. The availability of efficient nuclear and chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas provides specific advantages for the study of chloroplast biogenesis, photosynthesis, and nuclear-chloroplast genome interactions.},

abstract = {Cancer evolves dynamically as clonal expansions supersede one another driven by shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes. These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50{\%} of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, challenges remain in understanding the source and distribution of the reads, modeling the transcript abundance and developing efficient computational methods. In this article, we develop a method to deal with the isoform expression estimation problem. The count of reads falling into a locus on the genome annotated with multiple isoforms is modeled as a Poisson variable. The expression of each individual isoform is estimated by solving a convex optimization problem and statistical inferences about the parameters are obtained from the posterior distribution by importance sampling. Our results show that isoform expression inference in RNA-Seq is possible by employing appropriate statistical methods.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is the main mechanism governing protein diversity. The recent developments in RNA-Seq technology have enabled the study of the global impact and regulation of this biological process. However, the lack of standardized protocols constitutes a major bottleneck in the analysis of alternative splicing. This is particularly important for the identification of exon-exon junctions, which is a critical step in any analysis workflow. Here we performed a systematic benchmarking of alignment tools to dissect the impact of design and method on the mapping, detection and quantification of splice junctions from multi-exon reads. Accordingly, we devised a novel pipeline based on TopHat2 combined with a splice junction detection algorithm, which we have named FineSplice. FineSplice allows effective elimination of spurious junction hits arising from artefactual alignments, achieving up to 99{\%} precision in both real and simulated data sets and yielding superior F1 scores under most tested conditions. The proposed strategy conjugates an efficient mapping solution with a semi-supervised anomaly detection scheme to filter out false positives and allows reliable estimation of expressed junctions from the alignment output. Ultimately this provides more accurate information to identify meaningful splicing patterns. FineSplice is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/p/finesplice/.},

Nine novel clades and single-taxon branches were identified, suggesting that current taxon sampling has not reached saturation in the family. The highly polyphyletic nature of most desmid genera corroborated in this study using a large taxon set, calls for re-evaluation of the genus concept in the family Desmidiaceae that traditionally relied on features of cell morphology. Molecular phylogenetic data have shown that these morphological characters are highly homoplastic or plesiomorphic and thus cannot be used to delineate genera. The dramatic discrepancy between the currently practised systematic treatment of the family and the composition of the clades based on sequence comparisons requires emendation of almost all existing genera and description of a larger number of novel genera. The clades identified during this study provide a framework for the future emendation/description of genera in the Desmidiaceae.},

abstract = {After two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist1,2. Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.},

@article{Oltean2013a,
abstract = {The immense majority of genes are alternatively spliced and there are many isoforms specifically associated with cancer progression and metastasis. The splicing pattern of specific isoforms of numerous genes is altered as cells move through the oncogenic process of gaining proliferative capacity, acquiring angiogenic, invasive, antiapoptotic and survival properties, becoming free from growth factor dependence and growth suppression, altering their metabolism to cope with hypoxia, enabling them to acquire mechanisms of immune escape, and as they move through the epithelial-mesenchymal and mesenchymal-epithelial transitions and metastasis. Each of the 'hallmarks of cancer' is associated with a switch in splicing, towards a more aggressive invasive cancer phenotype. The choice of isoforms is regulated by several factors (signaling molecules, kinases, splicing factors) currently being identified systematically by a number of high-throughput, independent and unbiased methodologies. Splicing factors are de-regulated in cancer, and in some cases are themselves oncogenes or pseudo-oncogenes and can contribute to positive feedback loops driving cancer progression. Tumour progression may therefore be associated with a coordinated splicing control, meaning that there is the potential for a relatively small number of splice factors or their regulators to drive multiple oncogenic processes. The understanding of how splicing contributes to the various phenotypic traits acquired by tumours as they progress and metastasise, and in particular how alternative splicing is coordinated, can and is leading to the development of a new class of anticancer therapeutics-the alternative-splicing inhibitors.Oncogene advance online publication, 16 December 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.533.},

abstract = {Trichosporon asahii is the most common cause of fatal disseminated trichosporonosis, frequently associated with indwelling medical devices. Despite the use of antifungal drugs to treat trichosporonosis, infection is often persistent and is associated with high mortality. This drove our interest in evaluating the capability of T. asahii to form a biofilm on biomaterial-representative polystyrene surfaces through the development and optimization of a reproducible T. asahii-associated biofilm model. Time course analyses of viable counts and a formazan salt reduction assay, as well as microscopy studies, revealed that biofilm formation by T. asahii occurred in an organized fashion through four distinct developmental phases: initial adherence of yeast cells (0 to 2 h), germination and microcolony formation (2 to 4 h), filamentation (4 to 6 h), and proliferation and maturation (24 to 72 h). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that mature T. asahii biofilms (72-h) displayed a complex, heterogeneous three-dimensional structure, consisting of a dense network of metabolically active yeast cells and hyphal elements completely embedded within exopolymeric material. Antifungal susceptibility testing demonstrated a remarkable rise in the MICs of sessile T. asahii cells against clinically used amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole, and fluconazole compared to their planktonic counterparts. In particular, T. asahii biofilms were up to 16,000 times more resistant to voriconazole, the most active agent against planktonic cells (MIC, 0.06 microg/ml). Our results suggest that the ability of T. asahii to form a biofilm may be a major factor in determining persistence of the infection in spite of in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates.},

abstract = {Antisense RNA-mediated transcriptional regulators are powerful tools for controlling gene expression and creating synthetic gene networks. RNA transcriptional repressors derived from natural mechanisms called attenuators are particularly versatile, though their mechanistic complexity has made them difficult to engineer. Here we identify a new structure–function design principle for attenuators that enables the forward engineering of new RNA transcriptional repressors. Using in-cell SHAPE-Seq to characterize the structures of attenuator variants within Escherichia coli, we show that attenuator hairpins that facilitate interaction with antisense RNAs require interior loops for proper function. Molecular dynamics simulations of these attenuator variants suggest these interior loops impart structural flexibility. We further observe hairpin flexibility in the cellular structures of natural RNA mechanisms that use antisense RNA interactions to repress translation, confirming earlier results from in vitro studies. Finally, we design new transcriptional attenuators in silico using an interior loop as a structural requirement and show that they function as desired in vivo. This work establishes interior loops as an important structural element for designing synthetic RNA gene regulators. We anticipate that the coupling of experimental measurement of cellular RNA structure and function with computational modeling will enable rapid discovery of structure–function design principles for a diverse array of natural and synthetic RNA regulators.},

abstract = {RNA exosomes are large multisubunit assemblies involved in controlled RNA processing. The archaeal exosome possesses a heterohexameric processing chamber with three RNase-PH-like active sites, capped by Rrp4- or Csl4-type subunits containing RNA-binding domains. RNA degradation by RNA exosomes has not been studied in a quantitative manner because of the complex kinetics involved, and exosome features contributing to efficient RNA degradation remain unclear. Here we derive a quantitative kinetic model for degradation of a model substrate by the archaeal exosome. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for parameter estimation allow for the comparison of reaction kinetics between different exosome variants and substrates. We show that long substrates are degraded in a processive and short RNA in a more distributive manner and that the cap proteins influence degradation speed. Our results, supported by small angle X-ray scattering, suggest that the Rrp4-type cap efficiently recruits RNA but prevents fast RNA degradation of longer RNAs by molecular friction, likely by RNA contacts to its unique KH-domain. We also show that formation of the RNase-PH like ring with entrapped RNA is not required for high catalytic efficiency, suggesting that the exosome chamber evolved for controlled processivity, rather than for catalytic chemistry in RNA decay.},

abstract = {A comparison of Alu sequences that comprise more recently amplified Alu subfamilies was made. There are 18 individual diagnostic mutations associated with the different subfamilies. This analysis confirmed that the formation of each subfamily can be explained by the sequential accumulation of mutations relative to the previous subfamily. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of orthologous loci in several primate species allowed us to determine the time of insertion of Alu sequences in individual loci. These data suggest that the vast majority of Alu elements amplified at any given time comprised a single Alu subfamily. We find that, although the individual divergence relative to a consensus sequence correlate reasonably well with sequence age, the diagnostic mutations are a more accurate measure of the age of any individual Alu family member. Our data are consistent with a model in which all Alu family members have been made from a single master gene or from a series of sequential master genes. This master gene(s) accumulated diagnostic base changes, resulting in the amplification of different subfamilies from the master gene at different times in primate evolution. The changes in the master gene(s) probably occurred individually, but their appearance is clearly punctuated. Ten of them have occurred within an ∼15-million-year time span, 40-25 million years ago, and 8 changes have occurred within the last 5 million years. Surprisingly, no changes appeared in the 20 milion years separating these periods. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

Two additional modified cytosine bases, 5-carboxylcytosine (caC) and 5-formylcytosine (fC), are produced during enzymatic conversion of hmC to cytosine in mammalian cells. Thus, an accurate picture of the cytosine epigenetic status in target cells should also include these C5-cytosine variants. In the present study, we used a patch clamp amplifier to acquire ionic current traces caused by phi29 DNA polymerase-controlled translocation of DNA templates through the M2MspA pore. Decision boundaries based on three consecutive ionic current states were implemented to call mC, hmC, caC, fC, or cytosine at CG dinucleotides in ∼4400 individual DNA molecules. We found that the percentage of correct base calls for single pass reads ranged from 91.6{\%} to 98.3{\%}.

Activation of Wnt downstream events during metamorphosis resulted in a complete oralization of the animals and repression of aboral structures (i.e. stolons). The expression of Wnt3, Tcf and Brachyury was upregulated and became ubiquitous. Rescue experiments using Tcf RNAi resulted in normal metamorphosis and quantitatively normal Wnt3 and Brachyury expression. Isolated, decapitated polyps regenerated only heads but no stolons. Activation of Wnt downstream targets in regenerating animals resulted in oralization of the polyps. Knocking down Tcf or Wnt3 by RNAi inhibited head regeneration and resulted in complex phenotypes that included ectopic aboral structures. Multiple heads then grew when the RNAi effect had dissipated. Our results provide functional evidence that Wnt promotes head formation but represses the formation of stolons, whereas downregulation of Wnt promotes stolons and represses head formation.},

In order to understand the ancestral function of Brachyury we cloned NemBra1, a Brachyury homolog from the anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Anthozoa are considered the basal group among the Cnidaria. First NemBra1 expression could be detected at the blastula/gastrula transition and gene activity persists until adulthood of the animals. In situ hybridization shows that NemBra1 expression in gastrulae and early planula larvae is restricted to a circle around the blastopore. When the larvae begin to metamorphose into primary polyps, the expression zone extends into the developing mesenteries. In adult polyps Brachyury expression persists in the mesenteries, but is excluded from the septal filament and the differentiated retractor muscles, which also develop from the mesenteries. We conclude that the ancestral function of Brachyury was in specifying the blastopore and its endodermal derivatives.},

abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly.

abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {Assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes is a facilitated quality-controlled process that typically includes modification to the RNA component from precursor to mature form. The SRP (signal recognition particle) is a cytosolic ribonucleoprotein that catalyses protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. Assembly of SRP is largely nucleolar, and most of its protein components are required to generate a stable complex. A pre-SRP is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the final protein, Srp54p, is incorporated. Although this outline of the SRP assembly pathway has been determined, factors that facilitate this and/or function in quality control of the RNA are poorly understood. In the present paper, the SRP assembly pathway is summarized, and evidence for the involvement of both the Rex1p and nuclear exosome nucleases and the TRAMP (Trf4-Air2-Mtr4p polyadenylation) adenylase in quality control of SRP RNA is discussed. The RNA component of SRP is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and both La, which binds all newly transcribed RNAs generated by this enzyme, and the nuclear Lsm complex are implicated in SRP RNA metabolism. {\textcopyright}The Authors.},

Following international guidelines for diagnostic methods with clinical application, reproducible standard operating procedures (SOP) were established for every step comprising our LC diagnosis method. We analyzed the expression of distinct mRNAs expressed from GATA6 and NKX2-1, key regulators of lung development. The Em/Ad expression ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1 detected in EBCs were combined using linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) into the LC score, which can be used for LC detection. LC score-based diagnosis achieved a high performance in an independent validation cohort.

Mice with IEC-specific FADD or caspase-8 deficiency developed colitis dependent on mixed lineage kinase-like (MLKL)-mediated epithelial cell necroptosis. However, MLKL deficiency fully prevented ileitis caused by epithelial caspase-8 ablation, but only partially ameliorated ileitis in mice lacking FADD in IECs. Our genetic studies revealed that caspase-8 and gasdermin-D (GSDMD) were both required for the development of MLKL-independent ileitis in mice with epithelial FADD deficiency. Therefore, FADD prevents intestinal inflammation downstream of ZBP1 and TNFR1 by inhibiting both MLKL-induced necroptosis and caspase-8-GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis-like death of epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

@article{Wu2013,
abstract = {With the astonishing rate that genomic and metagenomic sequence data sets are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene families have generally been referred to as "marker" genes. We are particularly interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities (e.g., construction of species trees, phylogenetic based assignment of metagenomic sequence reads to taxonomic groups, phylogeny-based assessment of alpha- and beta-diversity of microbial communities from metagenomic data). We therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology) markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for "all bacteria and archaea", 114 for "all bacteria (greatly expanding on the ∼30 commonly used), and 100 s to 1000 s for some of the individual phyla of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than possible previously.},

The alignments revealed a number of highly conserved amino acid residues that are involved in chromophore attachment and conformation, alpha-beta interactions and phycobilisome assembly. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the phycobiliprotein subfamilies, previously classified by their biochemical and spectroscopic properties, also formed coherent evolutionary groups. The alpha and beta subunits formed two distinct evolutionary lines that originate from a common ancestor. The pattern of divergence among the alpha subfamilies was identical to that of the beta subfamilies, strongly suggesting that the alpha and beta subunits of each phycobiliprotein type have coevolved. The phylogenetic data support a monophyletic separation of the eukaryotic sequences from the extant cyanobacterial sequences. The eukaryotic phycoerythrins appeared more closely related to the marine Synechococcus phycoerythrins than to the other cyanobacterial phycoerythrins. The cryptophyte phycobiliproteins formed a monophyletic group within the rhodophyte lineage. In conjunction with other phylogenetic markers, the analysis of additional phycobiliprotein sequences may help to further resolve the relationships among phycobiliprotein-containing organisms.},

abstract = {Germline copy number variants (CNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are of significant importance in syndromic conditions and cancer. Massively parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation. We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package CNVkit, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: GC content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of CNVkit to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of CNVkit so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for integration into existing analysis pipelines.

Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a widely used approach to study protein-DNA interactions. Often, the quantities of interest are the differential occupancies relative to controls, between genetic backgrounds, treatments, or combinations thereof. Current methods for differential occupancy of ChIP-Seq data rely however on binning or sliding window techniques, for which the choice of the window and bin sizes are subjective. Results: Here, we present GenoGAM (Genome-wide Generalized Additive Model), which brings the well-established and flexible generalized additive models framework to genomic applications using a data parallelism strategy. We model ChIP-Seq read count frequencies as products of smooth functions along chromosomes. Smoothing parameters are objectively estimated from the data by crossvalidation, eliminating ad hoc binning and windowing needed by current approaches. GenoGAM provides base-level and region-level significance testing for full factorial designs. Application to a ChIP-Seq dataset in yeast showed increased sensitivity over existing differential occupancy methods while controlling for type I error rate. By analyzing a set of DNA methylation data and illustrating an extension to a peak caller, we further demonstrate the potential of GenoGAM as a generic statistical modeling tool for genome-wide assays.},

The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the SILVA 16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef 108 NR). Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, ≥ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies.},

abstract = {How repetitive elements, epigenetic modifications, and architectural proteins interact ensuring proper genome expression remains poorly understood. Here, we report regulatory mechanisms unveiling a central role of Alu elements (AEs) and RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) in structurally and functionally modulating the genome via chromatin looping and histone acetylation. Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18). This facilitates the contacts of AEs with distant CTCF sites near promoter of other cell-cycle genes, which also become hyperacetylated at H3K18. These changes ensure basal transcription of cell-cycle genes and are critical for their re-activation upon serum re-exposure. Our study reveals how direct manipulation of the epigenetic state of AEs by a general transcription factor regulates 3D genome folding and expression.},

Based on surface marker expression individual cells at different stages of human B cell development are isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For each cell Ig heavy and corresponding Ig light chain gene transcripts are amplified by nested RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors to produce monoclonal human antibodies of the same specificity in vitro. All reactions are performed in 96-well plates and allow cloning of large numbers of Ig genes. The recombinant antibodies are tested for reactivity with diverse self- and non-self antigens and the reactivity profile can be directly linked to the complete Ig heavy and Ig light chain gene sequence information that is obtained as part of the cloning strategy. In summary, our method to clone and express human monoclonal antibodies is unbiased, highly efficient, requires only small cell numbers and the recombinant antibodies allow direct conclusions on the frequency of specific human B cells in a diverse repertoire.},

abstract = {Herpesviruses comprise an abundant, widely distributed group of large DNA viruses of humans and other vertebrates, and overall are among the most extensively studied large DNA viruses. Many herpesvirus genome sequences have been determined, and interpreted in terms of gene contents to give detailed views of both ubiquitous and lineage-specific functions. Availability of gene sequences has also enabled evaluations of evolutionary relationships. For herpesviruses of mammals, a robust phylogenetic tree has been constructed, which shows many features characteristic of synchronous development of virus and host lineages over large evolutionary timespans. It has also emerged that three distinct groupings of herpesviruses exist: the first containing viruses with mammals, birds and reptiles as natural hosts; the second containing viruses of amphibians and fish; and the third consisting of a single invertebrate herpesvirus. Within each of the first two groups, the genomes show clear evidence of descent from a common ancestor, but relationships between the three groups are extremely remote. Detailed analyses of capsid structures provide the best evidence for a common origin of the three groups. At a finer level, the structure of the capsid shell protein further suggests an element of common origin between herpesviruses and tailed DNA bacteriophages.},

@article{Gonzalez2011,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Considerable attention has been directed in recent years toward the development of methods for the contextual analysis of expression data using interaction networks. Of particular interest has been the identification of active subnetworks by detecting regions enriched with differential expression. In contrast, however, very little effort has been made toward the application of comparable methods to other types of high-throughput data.

RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method based on co-clustering that is specifically designed for the exploratory analysis of large-scale, RNAi-based functional screens. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to a genome-scale dataset aimed at identifying host factors of the human pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition to recovering known cellular modules relevant to HCV infection, the results enabled us to identify new candidates and formulate biological hypotheses regarding possible roles and mechanisms for a number of them. For example, our analysis indicated that HCV, similar to other enveloped viruses, exploits elements within the endosomal pathway in order to acquire a membrane and facilitate assembly and release. This echoed a number of recent studies which showed that the ESCRT-III complex is essential to productive infection.

To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non-small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti-PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape of lung cancers shape response to anti-PD-1 therapy.},

Here, we have characterized the performance of the Oxford MinION nanopore sequencer for detection and evaluation of organisms with a range of genomic nucleotide bias.

Finally, we have evaluated the performance of the current state-of-the-art neural network-based MinION basecaller, characterizing its behavior with respect to systemic errors as well as context- and sequence-specific errors. Overall, we present a detailed characterization the capabilities of the MinION in terms of generating high-accuracy sequence data from genomes with a wide range of nucleotide content.

Here, we assess the interplay of splicing repression by hnRNPC and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in the quality control and evolution of new Alu-exons. We identify 3100 new Alu-exons and show that NMD more efficiently recognises transcripts with Alu-exons compared to other exons with premature termination codons. However, some Alu-exons escape NMD, especially when an adjacent intron is retained, highlighting the importance of concerted repression by splicing and NMD. We show that evolutionary progression of 3' splice sites is coupled with longer repressive uridine tracts. Once the 3' splice site at ancient Alu-exons reaches a stable phase, splicing repression by hnRNPC decreases, but the exons generally remain sensitive to NMD. We conclude that repressive motifs are strongest next to cryptic exons and that gradual weakening of these motifs contributes to the evolutionary emergence of new alternative exons.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This article investigates a computationally simple variant of boosting, L2 Boost, which is constructed from a functional gradient descent algorithm with the L2-loss function. Like other boosting algorithms, L2 Boost uses many times in an iterative fashion a prechosen fitting method, called the learner. Based on the explicit expression of refitting of residuals of L2 Boost, the case with (symmetric) linear learners is studied in detail in both regression and classification. In particular, with the boosting iteration m working as the smoothing or regularization parameter, a new exponential bias-variance trade-off is found with the variance (complexity) term increasing very slowly as m tends to infinity. When the learner is a smoothing spline, an optimal rate of convergence result holds for both regression and classification and the boosted smoothing spline even adapts to higher-order, unknown smoothness. Moreover, a simple expansion of a (smoothed) 0-1 loss function is derived to reveal the importance of the decision boundary, bias reduction, and impossibility of an additive bias-variance decomposition in classification. Finally, simulation and real dataset results are obtained to demonstrate the attractiveness of L2 Boost. In particular, we demonstrate that L2 Boosting with a novel component-wise cubic smoothing spline is both practical and effective in the presence of high-dimensional predictors.},

abstract = {Background: Recent advances in single-molecule sequencing techniques, such as Nanopore sequencing, improved read length, increased sequencing throughput, and enabled direct detection of DNA modifications through the analysis of raw signals. These DNA modifications include naturally occurring modifications such as DNA methylations, as well as modifications that are introduced by DNA damage or through synthetic modifications to one of the four standard nucleotides. Methods: To improve the performance of detecting DNA modifications, especially synthetically introduced modifications, we developed a novel computational tool called NanoMod. NanoMod takes raw signal data on a pair of DNA samples with and without modified bases, extracts signal intensities, performs base error correction based on a reference sequence, and then identifies bases with modifications by comparing the distribution of raw signals between two samples, while taking into account of the effects of neighboring bases on modified bases ("neighborhood effects"). Results: We evaluated NanoMod on simulation data sets, based on different types of modifications and different magnitudes of neighborhood effects, and found that NanoMod outperformed other methods in identifying known modified bases. Additionally, we demonstrated superior performance of NanoMod on an E. coli data set with 5mC (5-methylcytosine) modifications. Conclusions: In summary, NanoMod is a flexible tool to detect DNA modifications with single-base resolution from raw signals in Nanopore sequencing, and will greatly facilitate large-scale functional genomics experiments in the future that use modified nucleotides.},

abstract = {Objectives: To identify clinical, angiographic and hemodynamic predictors of discordance between instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR). Background: The iFR was found to be non-inferior to the gold-standard FFR for guiding coronary revascularization, although it is discordant with FFR in 20{\%} of cases. A better understanding of the causes of discordance may enhance application of these indices. Methods: Both FFR and iFR were measured in the prospective multicenter CONTRAST study. Clinical, angiographic and hemodynamic variables were compared between patients with concordant values of FFR and iFR (cutoff ≤0.80 and ≤0.89, respectively). Results: Out of the 587 patients included, in 466 patients (79.4{\%}) FFR and iFR agreed: both negative, n = 244 (41.6{\%}), or positive, n = 222 (37.8{\%}). Compared with FFR, iFR was negative discordant (FFR+/iFR-) in 69 (11.8{\%}) patients and positive discordant (FFR-/iFR+) in 52 (8.9{\%}) patients. On multivariate regression, stenosis location (left main or proximal left anterior descending) (OR: 3.30[1.68;6.47]), more severe stenosis (OR: 1.77[1.35;2.30]), younger age (OR: 0.93[0.90;0.97]), and slower heart rate (OR: 0.59[0.42;0.75]) were predictors of a negative discordant iFR. Absence of a beta-blocker (OR: 0.41[0.22;0.78]), older age (OR: 1.04[1.00;1.07]), and less severe stenosis (OR: 0.69[0.53;0.89]) were predictors of a positive discordant iFR. Conclusions: During iFR acquisition, stenosis location, stenosis degree, heart rate, age and use of beta blockers influence concordance with FFR and should be taken into account when interpreting iFR.},

abstract = {Genes underlying mutant phenotypes can be isolated by combining marker discovery, genetic mapping and resequencing, but a more straightforward strategy for mapping mutations would be the direct comparison of mutant and wild-type genomes. Applying such an approach, however, is hampered by the need for reference sequences and by mutational loads that confound the unambiguous identification of causal mutations. Here we introduce NIKS (needle in the k-stack), a reference-free algorithm based on comparing k-mers in whole-genome sequencing data for precise discovery of homozygous mutations. We applied NIKS to eight mutants induced in nonreference rice cultivars and to two mutants of the nonmodel species Arabis alpina. In both species, comparing pooled F2 individuals selected for mutant phenotypes revealed small sets of mutations including the causal changes. Moreover, comparing M3 seedlings of two allelic mutants unambiguously identified the causal gene. Thus, for any species amenable to mutagenesis, NIKS enables forward genetics without requiring segregating populations, genetic maps and reference sequences.},

abstract = {Short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) are a type of retroposon, being members of a class of informational molecules that are amplified via cDNA intermediates and flow back into the host genome. In contrast to retroviruses and retrotransposons, SINEs do not encode the enzymes required for their amplification, such as reverse transcriptases, so they are presumed to borrow these enzymes from other sources. In the present study, we isolated a family of long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) from the turtle genome. The sequence of this family was found to be very similar to those of the avian CR1 family. To our surprise, the sequence at the 3' end of the LINE in the turtle genome was nearly identical to that of a family of tortoise SINEs. Since CR1-like LINEs are widespread in birds and in many other reptiles, including the turtle, and since the tortoise SINEs are only found in vertical-necked turtles, it seems possible that the sequence at the 3' end of the tortoise SINEs might have been generated by recombination with the CR1-like LINE in a common ancestor of vertical-necked turtles, after the divergence of side-necked turtles. We extended our observations to show that the 3'-end sequences of families of several tRNA-derived SINEs, such as the salmonid HpaI family, the tobacco TS family, and the salmon SmaI family, might have originated from the respective LINEs. Since it appears reasonable that the recognition sites of LINEs for reverse transcriptase are located within their 3'-end sequences, these results provide the basis for a general scheme for the mechanism by which SINEs might acquire retropositional activity. We propose here that tRNA-derived SINEs might have been generated by a recombination event in which a strong-stop DNA with a primer tRNA, which is an intermediate in the replication of certain retroviruses and long terminal repeat retrotransposons, was directly integrated at the 3' end of a LINE.},

abstract = {Imprinted genes play an important role in fetal and placental development. Using quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing assays, we determined the DNA methylation levels at two paternally methylated (H19 and MEG3) and four maternally methylated (LIT1, NESP55, PEG3, and SNRPN) imprinted regions in fetal muscle samples from abortions and stillbirths. Two of 55 (4{\%}) spontaneous abortions and 10 of 57 (18{\%}) stillbirths displayed hypermethylation in multiple genes. Interestingly, none of 34 induced abortions had extreme methylation values in multiple genes. All but two abortions/ stillbirths with multiple methylation abnormalities were male, indicating that the male embryo may be more susceptible to excess methylation. Hypermethylation of multiple imprinted genes is consistent with stochastic failures of the mechanism, which normally protects the hypomethylated allele from de novo methylation after fertilization. Two of six informative abortions/ stillbirths with H19 hypermethylation revealed significant biallelic expression of the autocrine growth factor IGF2. In two other cases hypermethylation of MEG3 was associated with transcriptional down-regulation. We propose that primary epimutations resulting in inappropriate methylation and expression patterns of imprinted genes may contribute to both normal human variation and disease, in particular spontaneous pregnancy loss.

abstract = {We applied a novel method to detect single or multiple exon deletions and amplifications in the BRCA1 gene. The test, called multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), uses probes designed to hybridize adjacently to the target sequence. After ligation, the joined probes are amplified and quantified. Our two diagnostic laboratories have tested in the recent years 805 families by conventional PCR-based techniques, and found 116 BRCA1 and 28 BRCA2 mutation-positive families. Using MLPA, we have tested the remaining 661 noninformative breast cancer families and identified five distinct BRCA1 germ-line mutations in five families: a deletion of exon 8, a deletion of exons 20-22, a duplication of exon 13 and exons 21-23, respectively, and a triplication, encompassing exons 17-19. Genomic deletions of BRCA1 constitute a substantial fraction of mutations in Dutch breast cancer families. If MLPA had been included in our initial BRCA1 testing, 33 families with a deletion or duplication would have been identified, representing 27{\%} of the total 121 BRCA1 mutation-positive families. The MLPA test for BRCA1 ensures a sensitive and comprehensive high-throughput screening test for genomic rearrangement and can easily be implemented in the molecular analysis of BRCA1.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic gene transcription is often controlled at the level of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing in the promoter-proximal region. Pausing Pol II limits the frequency of transcription initiation (‘pause-initiation limit'), predicting that the pause duration must be decreased for transcriptional activation. To test this prediction, we conduct a genome-wide kinetic analysis of the heat shock response in human cells. We show that the pause-initiation limit restricts transcriptional activation at most genes. Gene activation generally requires the activity of the P-TEFb kinase CDK9, which decreases the duration of Pol II pausing and thereby enables an increase in the productive initiation frequency. The transcription of enhancer elements is generally not pause limited and can be activated without CDK9 activity. Our results define the kinetics of Pol II transcriptional regulation in human cells at all gene classes during a natural transcription response.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genes often generate a variety of RNA isoforms that can lead to functionally distinct protein variants. The synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms is however poorly characterized. The reason for this is that current methods to quantify RNA metabolism use ‘short-read' sequencing that cannot detect RNA isoforms. Here we present nanopore sequencing-based Isoform Dynamics (nano-ID), a method that detects newly synthesized RNA isoforms and monitors isoform metabolism. nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling, ‘long-read' nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules and machine learning. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their synthesis rate, stability, and splicing pattern. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. And although combined RNA stability correlates with poly(A)-tail length, individual RNA isoforms can deviate significantly. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.},

We have developed a generic method for the identification of SUMO acceptor lysines in target proteins. We have identified 103 SUMO-2 acceptor lysines in endogenous target proteins. Of these acceptor lysines, 76 are situated in the SUMOylation consensus site [VILMFPC]KxE. Interestingly, eight sites fit the inverted SUMOylation consensus motif [ED]xK[VILFP]. In addition, we found direct mass spectrometric evidence for crosstalk between SUMOylation and phosphorylation with a preferred spacer between the SUMOylated lysine and the phosphorylated serine of four residues. In 16 proteins we identified a hydrophobic cluster SUMOylation motif (HCSM). SUMO conjugation of RanGAP1 and ZBTB1 via HCSMs is remarkably efficient.},

abstract = {Most freshwater flagellates use contractile vacuoles (CVs) to expel excess water. We have used Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a green model system to investigate CV function during adaptation to osmotic changes in culture medium. We show that the contractile vacuole in Chlamydomonas is regulated in two different ways. The size of the contractile vacuoles increases during cell growth, with the contraction interval strongly depending on the osmotic strength of the medium. In contrast, there are only small fluctuations in cytosolic osmolarity and plasma membrane permeability. Modeling of the CV membrane permeability indicates that only a small osmotic gradient is necessary for water flux into the CV, which is most likely facilitated by the aquaporin major intrinsic protein 1 (MIP1). We show that MIP1 is localized to the contractile vacuole, and that the expression rate and protein level of MIP1 exhibit only minor fluctuations under different osmotic conditions. In contrast, SEC6, a protein of the exocyst complex that is required for the water expulsion step, and a dynamin-like protein are upregulated under strong hypotonic conditions. Overexpression of a CreMIP1-GFP construct did not change the physiology of the CV. The functional implications of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {An important missing piece in the puzzle of how plastids spread across the eukaryotic tree of life is a robust evolutionary framework for the host lineages. Four assemblages are known to harbour plastids derived from red algae and, according to the controversial chromalveolate hypothesis, these all share a common ancestry. Phylogenomic analyses have consistently shown that stramenopiles and alveolates are closely related, but haptophytes and cryptophytes remain contentious; they have been proposed to branch together with several heterotrophic groups in the newly erected Hacrobia. Here, we tested this question by producing a large expressed sequence tag dataset for the katablepharid Roombia truncata, one of the last hacrobian lineages for which genome-level data are unavailable, and combined this dataset with the recently completed genome of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta to build an alignment composed of 258 genes. Our analyses strongly support haptophytes as sister to the SAR group, possibly together with telonemids and centrohelids. We also confirmed the common origin of katablepharids and cryptophytes, but these lineages were not related to other hacrobians; instead, they branch with plants. Our study resolves the evolutionary position of haptophytes, an ecologically critical component of the oceans, and proposes a new hypothesis for the origin of cryptophytes.},

Electroporation of strains CC3395 and CC425, cell wall-less mutants devoid of argininosuccinate lyase (encoded by ARG7), in the presence of the plasmid pJD67 (which contains ARG7) was used to optimize conditions for the introduction of exogenous DNA. The conditions that were varied included osmolarity, temperature, concentration of exogenous DNA, voltage and capacitance. Following optimization, the maximum transformation frequency obtained was 2 x 10(5) transformants per microg of DNA; this frequency is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained with the current standard method using glass beads to introduce exogenous DNA. The electroporation procedure described in this article is of general utility, and makes it feasible to isolate genes by direct complementation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants.},

abstract = {Summary.? We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p?n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

abstract = {Alternative processing of pre-mRNA transcripts is a major source of protein diversity in eukaryotes and has been implicated in several disease processes including cancer. In this study we have performed a genome wide analysis of alternative splicing events in lung adenocarcinoma. We found that 2369 of the 17 800 core Refseq genes appear to have alternative transcripts that are differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma versus normal. According to their known functions the largest subset of these genes (30.8{\%}) is believed to be cancer related. Detailed analysis was performed for several genes using PCR, quantitative RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. We found overexpression of ERG variant 2 but not variant 1 in lung tumors and overexpression of CEACAM1 variant 1 but not variant 2 in lung tumors but not in breast or colon tumors. We also identified a novel, overexpressed variant of CDH3 and verified the existence and overexpression of a novel variant of P16 transcribed from the CDKN2A locus. These findings demonstrate how analysis of alternative pre-mRNA processing can shed additional light on differences between tumors and normal tissues as well as between different tumor types. Such studies may lead to the development of additional tools for tumor diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.},

abstract = {Background Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses have offered much insight into cell-specific gene expression profiles in normal kidneys. However, in diseased kidneys, understanding of changes in specific cells, particularly glomerular cells, remains limited. Methods To elucidate the glomerular cell–specific gene expression changes in diabetic kidney disease, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of isolated glomerular cells from streptozotocin-induced diabetic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)–deficient (eNOS2/2) mice and control eNOS2/2 mice. Results We identified five distinct cell populations, including glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, podocytes, immune cells, and tubular cells. Using scRNA-seq analysis, we confirmed the expression of glomerular cell–specific markers and also identified several new potential markers of glomerular cells. The number of immune cells was significantly higher in diabetic glomeruli compared with control glomeruli, and further cluster analysis showed that these immune cells were predominantly macrophages. Analysis of differential gene expression in endothelial and mesangial cells of diabetic and control mice showed dynamic changes in the pattern of expressed genes, many of which are known to be involved in diabetic kidney disease. Moreover, gene expression analysis showed variable responses of individual cells to diabetic injury. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the ability of scRNA-seq analysis in isolated glomerular cells from diabetic and control mice to reveal dynamic changes in gene expression in diabetic kidneys, with variable responses of individual cells. Such changes, which might not be apparent in bulk transcriptomic analysis of glomerular cells, may help identify important pathophysiologic factors contributing to the progression of diabetic kidney disease.},

abstract = {High-throughput RNA sequencing has revealed more pervasive transcription of the human genome than previously anticipated. However, the extent of natural antisense transcripts' (NATs) expression, their regulation of cognate sense genes, and the role of NATs in cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we use strand-specific paired-end RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) data from 376 cancer samples covering nine tissue types to comprehensively characterize the landscape of antisense expression. We found consistent antisense expression in at least 38{\%} of annotated transcripts, which in general is positively correlated with sense gene expression. Investigation of sense/antisense pair expressions across tissue types revealed lineage-specific, ubiquitous and cancer-specific antisense loci transcription. Comparisons between tumor and normal samples identified both concordant (same direction) and discordant (opposite direction) sense/antisense expression patterns. Finally, we provide OncoNAT, a catalog of cancer-related genes with significant antisense transcription, which will enable future investigations of sense/antisense regulation in cancer. Using OncoNAT we identified several functional NATs, including NKX2-1-AS1 that regulates the NKX2-1 oncogene and cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive account of NATs and supports a role for NATs' regulation of tumor suppressors and oncogenes in cancer biology.},

@article{Hochreiter2007a,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: As more genomes are sequenced, the demand for fast gene classification techniques is increasing. To analyze a newly sequenced genome, first the genes are identified and translated into amino acid sequences which are then classified into structural or functional classes. The best-performing protein classification methods are based on protein homology detection using sequence alignment methods. Alignment methods have recently been enhanced by discriminative methods like support vector machines (SVMs) as well as by position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) as obtained from PSI-BLAST. However, alignment methods are time consuming if a new sequence must be compared to many known sequences-the same holds for SVMs. Even more time consuming is to construct a PSSM for the new sequence. The best-performing methods would take about 25 days on present-day computers to classify the sequences of a new genome (20,000 genes) as belonging to just one specific class--however, there are hundreds of classes. Another shortcoming of alignment algorithms is that they do not build a model of the positive class but measure the mutual distance between sequences or profiles. Only multiple alignments and hidden Markov models are popular classification methods which build a model of the positive class but they show low classification performance. The advantage of a model is that it can be analyzed for chemical properties common to the class members to obtain new insights into protein function and structure. We propose a fast model-based recurrent neural network for protein homology detection, the 'Long Short-Term Memory' (LSTM). LSTM automatically extracts indicative patterns for the positive class, but in contrast to profile methods it also extracts negative patterns and uses correlations between all detected patterns for classification. LSTM is capable to automatically extract useful local and global sequence statistics like hydrophobicity, polarity, volume, polarizability and combine them with a pattern. These properties make LSTM complementary to alignment-based approaches as it does not use predefined similarity measures like BLOSUM or PAM matrices. RESULTS: We have applied LSTM to a well known benchmark for remote protein homology detection, where a protein must be classified as belonging to a SCOP superfamily. LSTM reaches state-of-the-art classification performance but is considerably faster for classification than other approaches with comparable classification performance. LSTM is five orders of magnitude faster than methods which perform slightly better in classification and two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest SVM-based approaches (which, however, have lower classification performance than LSTM). Only PSI-BLAST and HMM-based methods show comparable time complexity as LSTM, but they cannot compete with LSTM in classification performance. To test the modeling capabilities of LSTM, we applied LSTM to PROSITE classes and interpreted the extracted patterns. In 8 out of 15 classes, LSTM automatically extracted the PROSITE motif. In the remaining 7 cases alternative motifs are generated which give better classification results on average than the PROSITE motifs. AVAILABILITY: The LSTM algorithm is available from http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/LSTM{\_}protein/.},

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy.

abstract = {Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) can enter cells via endocytic pathways or direct fusion at the plasma membrane depending on the cell line and receptor(s). Most studies into virus entry have used cultured fibroblasts but since keratinocytes represent the primary entry site for HSV-1 infection in its human host, we initiated studies to characterize the entry pathway of HSV-1 into human keratinocytes. Electron microscopy studies visualized free capsids in the cytoplasm and enveloped virus particles in vesicles suggesting viral uptake both by direct fusion at the plasma membrane and by endocytic vesicles. The ratio of the two entry modes differed in primary human keratinocytes and in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Inhibitor studies further support a role for endocytosis during HSV-1 entry. Infection was inhibited by the cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin, which demonstrates the requirement for host cholesterol during virus entry. Since the dynamin-specific inhibitor dynasore and overexpression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant blocked infection, we conclude that the entry pathways into keratinocytes are dynamin-mediated. Electron microscopy studies confirmed that virus uptake is completely blocked when the GTPase activity of dynamin is inhibited. Ex vivo infection of murine epidermis that was treated with dynasore further supports the essential role of dynamin during entry into the epithelium. Thus, we conclude that HSV-1 can enter human keratinocytes by alternative entry pathways that require dynamin and host cholesterol.},

abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown thai the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.

abstract = {The common bacterial base modification N6-methyladenine (m6A) is involved in many pathways related to an organism's ability to survive and interact with its environment. Recent research has shown that nanopore sequencing can detect m5C with per-read accuracy of upwards of 80{\%} but m6A with significantly lower accuracy. Here we use a binary classifier to improve m6A classification by marking adenines as methylated or unmethylated based on differences between measured and expected current values as each adenine travels through the nanopore. We also illustrate the importance of read quality for base modification detection and compare to PacBio methylation calls. With recent demonstrations of nanopore sequencing in Antarctica and onboard the International Space Station, the ability to reliably characterize m6A presents an opportunity to further examine the role of methylation in bacterial adaptation to extreme environments.},

abstract = {Motivation Antimicrobial resistance has become a major worldwide public health concern, calling for a better characterization of existing and novel resistance mechanisms. GWAS methods applied to bacterial genomes have shown encouraging results for new genetic marker discovery. Most existing approaches either look at SNPs obtained by sequence alignment or consider sets of kmers, whose presence in the genome is associated with the phenotype of interest. While the former approach can only be performed when genomes are similar enough for an alignment to make sense, the latter can lead to redundant descriptions and to results which are hard to interpret. Results We propose an alignment-free GWAS method detecting haplotypes of variable length associated to resistance, using compacted De Bruijn graphs. Our representation is flexible enough to deal with very plastic genomes subject to gene transfers while drastically reducing the number of features to explore compared to kmers, without loss of information. It accomodates polymorphisms in core genes, accessory genes and noncoding regions. Using our representation in a GWAS leads to the selection of a small number of entities which are easier to visualize and interpret than fixed-length kmers. We illustrate the benefit of our approach by describing known as well as potential novel determinants of antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, a pathogenic bacteria with a highly plastic genome.

abstract = {We found that transcription of endogenous human Alu elements by RNA polymerase III was strongly stimulated following infection of HeLa cells with adenovirus type 5, leading to the accumulation of high levels of Alu transcripts initiated from Alu polymerase III promoters. In contrast to previously reported cases of adenovirus-induced activation of polymerase III transcription, induction required the E1b 58-kDa protein and the products of E4 open reading frames 3 and 6 in addition to the 289-residue E1a protein. In addition, E1a function was not required at high multiplicities of infection, suggesting that E1a plays an indirect role in Alu activation. These results suggest previously unsuspected regulatory properties of the adenovirus E1b and E4 gene products and provide a novel approach to the study of the biology of the most abundant class of dispersed repetitive DNA in the human genome.},

abstract = {The PARKIN ubiquitin ligase (also known as PARK2) and its regulatory kinase PINK1 (also known as PARK6), often mutated in familial early-onset Parkinson's disease, have central roles in mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy. Whereas PARKIN is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon depolarization via PINK1 action and can ubiquitylate porin, mitofusin and Miro proteins on the MOM, the full repertoire of PARKIN substrates--the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome--remains poorly defined. Here we use quantitative diGly capture proteomics (diGly) to elucidate the ubiquitylation site specificity and topology of PARKIN-dependent target modification in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Hundreds of dynamically regulated ubiquitylation sites in dozens of proteins were identified, with strong enrichment for MOM proteins, indicating that PARKIN dramatically alters the ubiquitylation status of the mitochondrial proteome. Using complementary interaction proteomics, we found depolarization-dependent PARKIN association with numerous MOM targets, autophagy receptors, and the proteasome. Mutation of the PARKIN active site residue C431, which has been found mutated in Parkinson's disease patients, largely disrupts these associations. Structural and topological analysis revealed extensive conservation of PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylation sites on cytoplasmic domains in vertebrate and Drosophila melanogaster MOM proteins. These studies provide a resource for understanding how the PINK1-PARKIN pathway re-sculpts the proteome to support mitochondrial homeostasis.},

Reliable primer design is crucial for successful PCR, and for over a decade, the open-source Primer3 software has been widely used for primer design, often in high-throughput genomics applications. It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3's functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement-a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

However, this fungus has been recognized as an opportunistic agent of invasive infections, mostly in cancer patients and those exposed to invasive medical procedures. It is possible that the ability of Trichosporon strains to form biofilms on implanted devices, the presence of glucuronoxylomannan in their cell walls, and the ability to produce proteases and lipases are all factors likely related to the virulence of this genus and therefore may account for the progress of invasive trichosporonosis. Disseminated trichosporonosis has been increasingly reported worldwide and represents a challenge for both diagnosis and species identification. Phenotypic identification methods are useful for Trichosporon sp. screening, but only molecular methods, such as IGS region sequencing, allow the complete identification of Trichosporon isolates at the species level. Methods for the diagnosis of invasive trichosporonosis include PCR-based methods, Luminex xMAP technology, and, more recently, proteomics. Treating patients with trichosporonosis remains a challenge because of limited data on the in vitro and in vivo activities of antifungal drugs against clinically relevant species of the genus. Despite the mentioned limitations, the use of antifungal regimens containing triazoles appears to be the best therapeutic approach.},

Most alignment-free methods rely on exact word matches to estimate pairwise similarities or distances between the input sequences. By contrast, our new algorithms are based on inexact word matches. The first of these approaches uses the relative frequencies of so-called spaced words in the input sequences, i.e. words containing 'don't care' or 'wildcard' symbols at certain pre-defined positions. Various distance measures can then be defined on sequences based on their different spaced-word composition. Our second approach defines the distance between two sequences by estimating for each position in the first sequence the length of the longest substring at this position that also occurs in the second sequence with up to k mismatches. Both approaches take a set of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein sequences as input and return a matrix of pairwise distance values that can be used as a starting point for clustering algorithms or distance-based phylogeny reconstruction. The two alignment-free programmes are accessible through a web interface at 'G{\"{o}}ttingen Bioinformatics Compute Server (GOBICS)': http://spaced.gobics.de http://kmacs.gobics.de and the source codes can be downloaded.},

abstract = {Alu elements have amplified in primate genomes through a RNA-dependent mechanism, termed retroposition, and have reached a copy number in excess of 500,000 copies per human genome. These elements have been proposed to have a number of functions in the human genome, and have certainly had a major impact on genomic architecture. Alu elements continue to amplify at a rate of about one insertion every 200 new births. We have found 16 examples of diseases caused by the insertion of Alu elements, suggesting that they may contribute to about 0.1{\%} of human genetic disorders by this mechanism. The large number of Alu elements within primate genomes also provides abundant opportunities for unequal homologous recombination events. These events often occur intrachromosomally, resulting in deletion or duplication of exons in a gene, but they also can occur interchromosomally, causing more complex chromosomal abnormalities. We have found 33 cases of germline genetic diseases and 16 cases of cancer caused by unequal homologous recombination between Alu repeats. We estimate that this mode of mutagenesis accounts for another 0.3{\%} of human genetic diseases. Between these different mechanisms, Alu elements have not only contributed a great deal to the evolution of the genome but also continue to contribute to a significant portion of human genetic diseases.},

Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is the average common substring approach that defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings with k mismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of such k-mismatch substrings, and we describe kmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of DNA and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated with kmacs were more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods that are based on exact word matches. Especially on protein sequences, our method seems to be superior. On simulated protein families, kmacs even outperformed a classical approach to phylogeny reconstruction using multiple alignment and maximum likelihood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: kmacs is implemented in C++, and the source code is freely available at http://kmacs.gobics.de/.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In membrane trafficking, the mechanisms ensuring vesicle fusion specificity remain to be fully elucidated. Early models proposed that specificity was encoded entirely by SNARE proteins; more recent models include contributions from Rab proteins, Syntaxin-binding (SM) proteins and tethering factors. Most information on membrane trafficking derives from an evolutionarily narrow sampling of model organisms. However, considering factors from a wider diversity of eukaryotes can provide both functional information on core systems and insight into the evolutionary history of the trafficking machinery. For example, the major Qa/syntaxin SNARE families are present in most eukaryotic genomes and likely each evolved via gene duplication from a single ancestral syntaxin before the existing eukaryotic groups diversified. This pattern is also likely for Rabs and various other components of the membrane trafficking machinery.

RESULTS: We performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, when relevant, on the SM proteins and components of the tethering complexes, both thought to contribute to vesicle fusion specificity. Despite evidence suggestive of secondary losses amongst many lineages, the tethering complexes are well represented across the eukaryotes, suggesting an origin predating the radiation of eukaryotic lineages. Further, whilst we detect distant sequence relations between GARP, COG, exocyst and DSL1 components, these similarities most likely reflect convergent evolution of similar secondary structural elements. No similarity is found between the TRAPP and HOPS complexes and the other tethering factors. Overall, our data favour independent origins for the various tethering complexes. The taxa examined possess at least one homologue of each of the four SM protein families; since the four monophyletic families each encompass a wide diversity of eukaryotes, the SM protein families very likely evolved before the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LCEA).

CONCLUSION: These data further support a highly complex LCEA and indicate that the basic architecture of the trafficking system is remarkably conserved and ancient, with the SM proteins and tethering factors having originated very early in eukaryotic evolution. However, the independent origin of the tethering complexes suggests a novel pattern for increasing complexity in the membrane trafficking system, in addition to the pattern of paralogous machinery elaboration seen thus far.},

abstract = {The class Pedinophyceae was established for asymmetric uniflagellate green algae, and was originally considered as an ancestral lineage of viridiplants. However, analyses of 71 concatenated plastid proteins [Turmel et al. (2009): Mol. Biol. Evol. 26: 2317-2331] recovered Pedinomonas within the Chlorellales (Trebouxiophyceae), thereby questioning the Pedinophyceae as an independent class. For the present study, complete nuclear and plastid-encoded rRNA operon sequences have been determined for 37 taxa of green algae including 6 members of the Pedinophyceae, providing 9272 aligned nucleotide positions. Phylogenies using both rRNA operons consistently rejected any relationship between Pedinophyceae and the Chlorellales. Instead, the Pedinophyceae were significantly resolved as sister of all phycoplast-containing 'core' chlorophytes, i.e. Chlorodendrophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Reinvestigation of plastid proteins discovered biased phylogenetic signal among protein partitions, indicating the published Pedinomonas + Chlorellales association as likely artificial. Marine pedinophytes (Resultomonas and Marsupiomonas; Marsupiomonadales ord. nov.), formed a sister clade to the order Pedinomonadales, occurring in freshwater and soil habitats. Synapomorphies in rRNA secondary structures were integrated in taxonomic diagnoses of the Pedinophyceae and were also used for BLAST searches targeting environmental sequence databases. The latter approach revealed conserved habitat preferences for the Marsupiomonadales and Pedinomonadales, and identified several novel pedinophyte lineages.},

abstract = {Transcription of the eukaryotic genomes is carried out by three distinct RNA polymerases I, II, and III, whereby each polymerase is thought to independently transcribe a distinct set of genes. To investigate a possible relationship of RNA polymerases II and III, we mapped their in vivo binding sites throughout the human genome by using ChIP-Seq in two different cell lines, GM12878 and K562 cells. Pol III was found to bind near many known genes as well as several previously unidentified target genes. RNA-Seq studies indicate that a majority of the bound genes are expressed, although a subset are not suggestive of stalling by RNA polymerase III. Pol II was found to bind near many known Pol III genes, including tRNA, U6, HVG, hY, 7SK and previously unidentified Pol III target genes. Similarly, in vivo binding studies also reveal that a number of transcription factors normally associated with Pol II transcription, including c-Fos, c-Jun and c-Myc, also tightly associate with most Pol III-transcribed genes. Inhibition of Pol II activity using alpha-amanitin reduced expression of a number of Pol III genes (e.g., U6, hY, HVG), suggesting that Pol II plays an important role in regulating their transcription. These results indicate that, contrary to previous expectations, polymerases can often work with one another to globally coordinate gene expression.},

abstract = {Transcription of eukaryotic genes is performed by three nuclear RNA polymerases, of which RNA polymerase II is thought to be solely responsible for the synthesis of messenger RNAs. Here we show that transcription of some mRNAs in humans and rodents is mediated by a previously unknown single-polypeptide nuclear RNA polymerase (spRNAP-IV). spRNAP-IV is expressed from an alternative transcript of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase gene (POLRMT). The spRNAP-IV lacks 262 amino-terminal amino acids of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, including the mitochondrial-targeting signal, and localizes to the nucleus. Transcription by spRNAP-IV is resistant to the RNA polymease II inhibitor $\alpha$-amanitin but is sensitive to short interfering RNA specific for the POLRMT gene. The promoters for spRNAP-IV differ substantially from those used by RNA polymerase II, do not respond to transcriptional enhancers and contain a common functional sequence motif.},

abstract = {Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that use a germline 'copy-and-paste' mechanism to spread throughout metazoan genomes1. At least 50 per cent of the human genome is derived from retrotransposons, with three active families (L1, Alu and SVA) associated with insertional mutagenesis and disease 2,3. Epigenetic and post-transcriptional suppression block retrotransposition in somatic cells 4,5, excluding early embryo development and some malignancies 6,7. Recent reports of L1 expression 8,9 and copy number variation 10,11 in the human brain suggest that L1 mobilization may also occur during later development. However, the corresponding integration sites have not been mapped. Here we apply a high-throughput method to identify numerous L1, Alu and SVA germline mutations, as well as 7,743 putative somatic L1 insertions, in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of three individuals. Surprisingly, we also found 13,692 somatic Alu insertions and 1,350 SVA insertions. Our results demonstrate that retrotransposons mobilize to protein-coding genes differentially expressed and active in the brain. Thus, somatic genome mosaicism driven by retrotransposition may reshape the genetic circuitry that underpins normal and abnormal neurobiological processes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Bakin1993,
abstract = {A new technique has been developed for the facile location of pseudouridylate (psi) residues in any RNA molecule. The method uses two known modification procedures which in combination uniquely identify U residues which have been converted into psi. The first procedure involves reaction of all U-like and G-like residues with N-cyclohexyl-N'-beta-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethylcarbodiimide p-tosylate (CMC), followed by alkaline removal of all CMC groups except those linked to the N3 of psi. This stops reverse transcription, resulting in a gel band which identifies the U residue. The second procedure is uridine-specific hydrazinolysis which cleaves the RNA chain at all U residues and produces a gel band upon reverse transcription. psi residues, being resistant to hydrazinolysis, are not cleaved and do not stop reverse transcription. This leads to the absence of a band at psi residues. The combined method can also distinguish psi from 5-methyluridine, 4-thiouridine, uridine-5-oxyacetic acid, and 2-thio-5-methylaminomethyluridine as shown by treating rRNA and tRNA species known to contain these modified bases at defined sites. By this procedure, four new sites for psi in Escherichia coli 23S RNA were discovered, and one was disproven. The four new sites are at positions 2457, 2504, 2580, and 2605. The erroneous site is at position 2555. These four new psi residues, which are all in or within 2-3 residues of the peptidyltransferase ring, are thus in a position to play a functional and/or structural role at the peptidyltransferase center.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Aims: Randomised controlled trials have reported instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) to be non-inferior to fractional flow reserve (FFR) for major adverse cardiovascular events at one year; however, iFR is limited by sensitive landmarking of the pressure waveform, and the assumption that maximal flow and minimal resistance occur during a fixed period of diastole. We sought to validate the resting full-cycle ratio (RFR), a novel non-hyperaemic index of coronary stenosis severity based on unbiased identification of the lowest distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure ratio (Pd/Pa), independent of the ECG, landmark identification, and timing within the cardiac cycle. Methods and results: VALIDATE-RFR was a retrospective study designed to derive and validate the RFR. The primary endpoint was the agreement between RFR and iFR. RFR was retrospectively determined in 651 waveforms in which iFR was measured using a proprietary Philips/Volcano wire. RFR was highly correlated to iFR (R2=0.99, p{\textless}0.001), with a mean bias of -0.002 (95{\%} limits of agreement -0.023 to 0.020). The diagnostic performance of RFR versus iFR was diagnostic accuracy 97.4{\%}, sensitivity 98.2{\%}, specificity 96.9{\%}, positive predictive value 94.5{\%}, negative predictive value 99.0{\%}, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.996, and diagnostically equivalent within 1{\%} (mean difference -0.002; 95{\%} CI: -0.009 to 0.006, p=0.03). The RFR was detected outside diastole in 12.2{\%} (341/2,790) of all cardiac cycles and 32.4{\%} (167/516) of cardiac cycles in the right coronary artery where the sensitivity of iFR compared to FFR was lowest (40.6{\%}). Conclusions: RFR is diagnostically equivalent to iFR but unbiased in its ability to detect the lowest Pd/Pa during the full cardiac cycle, potentially unmasking physiologically significant coronary stenoses that would be missed by assessment dedicated to specific segments of the cardiac cycle.},

abstract = {The RNA transcriptome varies in response to cellular differentiation as well as environmental factors, and can be characterized by the diversity and abundance of transcript isoforms. Differential transcription analysis, the detection of differences between the transcriptomes of different cells, may improve understanding of cell differentiation and development and enable the identification of biomarkers that classify disease types. The availability of high-throughput short-read RNA sequencing technologies provides in-depth sampling of the transcriptome, making it possible to accurately detect the differences between transcriptomes. In this article, we present a new method for the detection and visualization of differential transcription. Our approach does not depend on transcript or gene annotations. It also circumvents the need for full transcript inference and quantification, which is a challenging problem because of short read lengths, as well as various sampling biases. Instead, our method takes a divide-and-conquer approach to localize the difference between transcriptomes in the form of alternative splicing modules (ASMs), where transcript isoforms diverge. Our approach starts with the identification of ASMs from the splice graph, constructed directly from the exons and introns predicted from RNA-seq read alignments. The abundance of alternative splicing isoforms residing in each ASM is estimated for each sample and is compared across sample groups. A non-parametric statistical test is applied to each ASM to detect significant differential transcription with a controlled false discovery rate. The sensitivity and specificity of the method have been assessed using simulated data sets and compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental validation using qRT-PCR confirmed a selected set of genes that are differentially expressed in a lung differentiation study and a breast cancer data set, demonstrating the utility of the approach applied on experimental biological data sets.

To develop transductional targeting and gene delivery by baculovirus, we focused on characterizing the nature and regulation of its uptake in human cancer cells. Baculovirus entered the cells along fluid-phase markers from the raft areas into smooth-surfaced vesicles devoid of clathrin. Notably, regulators associated with macropinocytosis, namely EIPA, Pak1, Rab34, and Rac1, had no significant effect on viral transduction, and the virus did not induce fluid-phase uptake. The internalization and nuclear uptake was, however, affected by mutants of RhoA, and of Arf6, a regulator of clathrin-independent entry. Furthermore, the entry of baculovirus induced ruffle formation and triggered the uptake of fluorescent E. coli bioparticles. To conclude, baculovirus enters human cells via a clathrin-independent pathway, which is able to trigger bacterial uptake. This study increases our understanding of virus entry strategies and gives new insight into baculovirus-mediated gene delivery in human cells.},

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their out- puts into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label un- segmented sequences directly, thereby solv- ing both problems.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs have gained increasing attention during the last decade. The first large group of non-coding RNAs to be characterized systematically starting at the beginning of the 21st century were small oligonucleotides--the so-called microRNAs (miRNAs). By now we have learnt that microRNAs are indispensable for most biological processes including organogenesis and maintenance of organ structure and function. The role of microRNAs has been studied extensively in the development of a number of organs, so far most studies focussed on e.g. the heart or the brain whilst the role of microRNAs in the development and maintenance of complex epithelial organs is less well understood. Furthermore most analyses regarding microRNA function in epithelial organs employed conditional knockout mouse models of the RNAse III Dicer to abrogate microRNA biogenesis. However, there is increasing evidence for Dicer to have multiple functions independent from microRNA maturation. Therefore Dicer independent models are needed to gain further insight into the complex biology of miRNA dependent processes. RESULTS: Here we analyze the contribution of microRNA-dependent transcriptional control in Pax8-expressing epithelial cells. Pax8 is a transcription factor that is crucial to the development of epithelial organs. The miRNA machinery was disrupted by crossing conditional DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (Dgcr8) fl/fl mice to Pax8Cre mice. The Dgcr8/Drosha complex processes pri-miRNAs in the nucleus before they are exported as pre-miRNAs for further maturation by Dicer in the cytoplasm. Dgcr8 fl/fl; Pax8Cre+ knockout mice died prematurely, developed massive hypothyroidism and end stage renal disease due to a loss of miRNAs in Pax8 expressing tissue. CONCLUSION: Pax8Cre-mediated conditional loss of DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (Dgcr8), an essential component of the nuclear machinery that is required for microRNA biogenesis, resulted in severe hypothyroidism, massively reduced body weight and ultimately led to renal failure and death of the animals. These data provide further insight into the importance of miRNAs in organ homeostasis using a Dicer independent model.},

abstract = {Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker for noninvasive assessment of cancer burden, but existing ctDNA detection methods have insufficient sensitivity or patient coverage for broad clinical applicability. Here we introduce cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an economical and ultrasensitive method for quantifying ctDNA. We implemented CAPP-Seq for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a design covering multiple classes of somatic alterations that identified mutations in {\textgreater}95{\%} of tumors. We detected ctDNA in 100{\%} of patients with stage II-IV NSCLC and in 50{\%} of patients with stage I, with 96{\%} specificity for mutant allele fractions down to ∼0.02{\%}. Levels of ctDNA were highly correlated with tumor volume and distinguished between residual disease and treatment-related imaging changes, and measurement of ctDNA levels allowed for earlier response assessment than radiographic approaches. Finally, we evaluated biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping with CAPP-Seq. We envision that CAPP-Seq could be routinely applied clinically to detect and monitor diverse malignancies, thus facilitating personalized cancer therapy.},

abstract = {In this letter, we investigate the impact of choosing different loss functions from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory. We introduce a convexity assumption, which is met by all loss functions commonly used in the literature, and study how the bound on the estimation error changes with the loss. We also derive a general result on the minimizer of the expected risk for a convex loss function in the case of classification. The main outcome of our analysis is that for classification, the hinge loss appears to be the loss of choice. Other things being equal, the hinge loss leads to a convergence rate practically indistinguishable from the logistic loss rate and much better than the square loss rate. Furthermore, if the hypothesis space is sufficiently rich, the bounds obtained for the hinge loss are not loosened by the thresholding stage.},

abstract = {Trafficking of protein and lipid cargo through the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is mediated by membrane-bound vesicles. Secretory vesicle targeting and fusion require a conserved multisubunit protein complex termed the exocyst, which has been implicated in specific tethering of vesicles to sites of polarized exocytosis. The exocyst is directly involved in regulating soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes and membrane fusion through interactions between the Sec6 subunit and the plasma membrane SNARE protein Sec9. Here we show another facet of Sec6 function-it directly binds Sec1, another SNARE regulator, but of the Sec1/Munc18 family. The Sec6-Sec1 interaction is exclusive of Sec6-Sec9 but compatible with Sec6-exocyst assembly. In contrast, the Sec6-exocyst interaction is incompatible with Sec6-Sec9. Therefore, upon vesicle arrival, Sec6 is proposed to release Sec9 in favor of Sec6-exocyst assembly and to simultaneously recruit Sec1 to sites of secretion for coordinated SNARE complex formation and membrane fusion.},

abstract = {Summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis (SHP) is type III or IV allergies developed by repeated inhalation of arthroconidia of Trichosporon species. We identified 105 strains obtained from the homes of 36 SHP patients by analysis of the intergenic spacer (IGS) 1 region, which is located between the 26S and 5S rRNA genes; in addition, we analyzed the IGS genotypes of the strains. Serologically, Trichosporon species are classified as serotype I, II, III, or I-III. Of the 105 strains, 43 (41.1{\%}), 53 (50.5{\%}), and 9 (8.6{\%}) strains were isolated as serotypes I, II, and III, respectively. Serotype I, II, and III strains were recovered from 19 (52.8{\%}), 29 (80.6{\%}), and 4 (11.1{\%}) of the 36 houses of SHP patients, respectively. No serotype I-III strains were isolated from the houses. Of 43 serotype I strains, 42 (97.7{\%}) were identified as Trichosporon dermatis, and the remaining one was T. terricola. Of 53 serotype II strains, 37 (69.8{\%}) were identified as T. asahii, and the remaining serotype II isolates were T. aquatile (1.9{\%}), T. coremiiforme (7.5{\%}), T. faecale (1.9{\%}), T. japonicum (15.1{\%}), and T. ovoides (3.8{\%}). There were nine serotype III strains comprised of T. montevideense (77.8{\%}) and T. domesticum (22.2{\%}). Intraspecies diversity was found only in T. asahii. This microorganism also causes opportunistic infections (trichosporonosis); seven genotypes of its IGS 1 region have been identified. While the strains of T. asahii obtained from Japanese patients with trichosporonosis were genotype I, the strains from the houses of SHP patients were genotype III. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the strains that play the most significant roles in the development of SHP are T. dermatis, T. asahii genotype 3, and T. montevideense, representing serotypes I, II, and III, respectively.},

abstract = {Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have recently been discovered to regulate mRNA transcription in trans, a role traditionally reserved for proteins. The breadth of ncRNAs as transacting transcriptional regulators and the diversity of signals to which they respond are only now becoming recognized. Here we show that human Alu RNA, transcribed from short interspersed elements (SINEs), is a transacting transcriptional repressor during the cellular heat shock response. Alu RNA blocks transcription by binding RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and entering complexes at promoters in vitro and in human cells. Transcriptional repression by Alu RNA involves two loosely structured domains that are modular, a property reminiscent of classical protein transcriptional regulators. Two other SINE RNAs, human scAlu RNA and mouse B1 RNA, also bind Pol II but do not repress transcription in vitro. These studies provide an explanation for why mouse cells harbor two major classes of SINEs, whereas human cells contain only one. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

abstract = {Micrasterias, the name of which is derived from the Greek for 'little star', comprises possibly the most spectacularly shaped desmids (Desmidiales, Streptophyta). Presently, the genus Micrasterias includes about 60 traditional species, the majority of which were described in the early 19th century. We used a comprehensive multigene dataset (including SSU rDNA, psaA, and coxIII loci) of 34 Micrasterias taxa to assess the relationships between individual morphological species. The resulting phylogeny was used to assess the patterns characterizing the morphological evolution of this genus. The phylogenetic analysis led to the recognition of eight well-resolved lineages that could be characterized by selected morphological features. Apart from the members of Micrasterias, three species belonged to different traditional desmid genera (Cosmarium, Staurodesmus, and Triploceras) and were inferred to be nested within the genus. Morphological comparisons of these species with their relatives revealed an accelerated rate of morphological evolution. Mapping morphological diversification of the genus on the phylogenetic tree revealed profound differences in the phylogenetic signal of selected phenotypic features. Whereas the branching pattern of the cells clearly correlated with the phylogeny, cell complexity possibly reflected rather their adaptive morphological responses to environmental conditions. Finally, ancestral reconstruction of distribution patterns indicated potential origin of the genus in North America, with additional speciation events occurring in the Indo-Malaysian region.},

abstract = {A 65-bp "core" sequence is dispersed in hundreds of thousands copies in the human genome. This sequence was found to constitute the central segment of a group of short interspersed elements (SINEs), referred to as mammalian-wide interspersed repeats, that proliferated before the radiation of placental mammals. Here, we propose that the core identifies an ancient tRNA-like SINE element, which survived in different lineages such as mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish, as well as mollusks, presumably for {\textgreater}550 million years. This element gave rise to a number of sequence families (CORE-SINEs), including mammalian-wide interspersed repeats, whose distinct 3' ends are shared with different families of long interspersed elements (LINEs). The evolutionary success of the generic CORE-SINE element can be related to the recruitment of the internal promoter from highly transcribed host RNA as well as to its capacity to adapt to changing retropositional opportunities by sequence exchange with actively amplifying LINEs. It reinforces the notion that the very existence of SINEs depends on the cohabitation with both LINEs and the host genome.},

Some members of each of the three subfamilies have inserted in the human genome so recently that about a one-third of the analyzed elements are polymorphic for the presence/absence of the Alu repeat in diverse human populations. These newly identified Alu insertion polymorphisms will serve as identical-by-descent genetic markers for the study of human evolution and forensics.

Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GenoSTAN generally identifies promoters and enhancers with significantly higher accuracy than previous methods. Moreover, Geno- STAN-derived promoters and enhancers showed significantly higher enrichment of complex trait-Associated genetic variants than current annotations. Altogether, GenoSTAN provides an easy-To-use tool to define promoters and enhancers in any system, and our annotation of human transcriptional cis-regulatory elements constitutes a rich resource for future research in biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Unlike most Hox cluster genes, with their canonical role in anterior-posterior patterning of the embryo, the Hox3 orthologue of insects has diverged. Here, we investigate the zen orthologue in Oncopeltus fasciatus (Hemiptera:Heteroptera). As in other insects, the Of-zen gene is expressed extraembryonically, and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments demonstrate that it is functionally required in this domain for the proper occurrence of katatrepsis, the phase of embryonic movements by which the embryo emerges from the yolk and adjusts its orientation within the egg. After RNAi knockdown of Of-zen, katatrepsis does not occur, causing embryos to complete development inside out. However, not all aspects of expression and function are conserved compared to grasshopper, beetle, and fly orthologues. Of-zen is not expressed in the extraembryonic tissue until relatively late, suggesting it is not involved in tissue specification. Within the extraembryonic domain, Of-zen is expressed in the outer serosal membrane, but unlike orthologues, it is not detectable in the inner extraembryonic membrane, the amnion. Thus, the role of zen in the interaction of serosa, amnion, and embryo may differ between species. Of-zen is also expressed in the blastoderm, although this early expression shows no apparent correlation with defects seen by RNAi knockdown.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: The L1 retrotransposable element family is the most successful self-replicating genomic parasite of the human genome. L1 elements drive replication of Alu elements, and both have had far-reaching impacts on the human genome. We use L1 and Alu insertion polymorphisms to analyze human population structure. Methods: We genotyped 75 recent, polymorphic L1 insertions in 317 individuals from 21 populations in sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, Europe and the Indian subcontinent. This is the first sample of L1 loci large enough to support detailed population genetic inference. We analyzed these data in parallel with a set of 100 polymorphic Alu insertion loci previously genotyped in the same individuals. Results and Conclusion: The data sets yield congruent results that support the recent African origin model of human ancestry. A genetic clustering algorithm detects clusters of individuals corresponding to continental regions. The number of loci sampled is critical: with fewer than 50 typical loci, structure cannot be reliably discerned in these populations. The inclusion of geographically intermediate populations (from India) reduces the distinctness of clustering. Our results indicate that human genetic variation is neither perfectly correlated with geographic distance (purely clinal) nor independent of distance (purely clustered), but a combination of both: stepped clinal.

DNA sequence-based methods offer an opportunity for faster, accurate diagnosis and for effective therapy. As our objective of the study, the ability of the Prove-it Sepsis platform, already proven as a rapid PCR- and microarray-based assay for the majority of sepsis-causing bacteria, was extended to also rapidly identify clinically relevant yeasts in blood culture. The performance characteristics of this extended platform are described. We found that the extended diagnostic Prove-it Sepsis platform was found to be highly accurate when analyzing primary isolates, spiked blood cultures, nucleic acid extracts from a retrospective blood culture data set, and primary blood cultures. Comparison of the blood culture results from the Prove-it Sepsis platform with those from conventional culture-based methods or by gene sequencing demonstrated a sensitivity of 99{\%} and a specificity of 98{\%} for fungal targets (based on analysis of a total of 388 specimens). Total assay time was 3 h from DNA extraction to BSI diagnosis. These results extend the performance characteristics of the Prove-it platform for bacteria to the easy, rapid, and accurate detection and species identification of yeasts in positive blood cultures. Incorporation of this extended and rapid diagnostic platform into the tools for clinical patient management would allow possibly faster identification and more focused therapies for BSIs.},

abstract = {Short interspersed elements (SINEs) make up a significant fraction of total DNA in mammalian genomes, providing a rich substrate for chromosomal rearrangements by SINE-SINE recombinations. Proliferation of mammalian SINEs is mediated primarily by long interspersed element 1 (L1) non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons that preferentially integrate at DNA sequence targets with an average length of approximately 15 bp and containing conserved endonucleolytic nicking signals at both ends. We report that sequence variations in the first of the two nicking signals, represented by a 5'-TT-AAAA consensus sequence, affect the position of the second signal thus leading to target site duplications (TSDs) of different lengths. The length distribution of TSDs appears to be affected also by L1-encoded enzyme variants because targets with the same 5' nicking site can be of different average lengths in different mammalian species. Taking this into account, we reanalyzed the second nicking site and found that it is larger and includes more conserved sites than previously appreciated, with a consensus of 5'-ANTNTN-AA. We also studied potential involvement of the nicking sites in stimulating recombinations between SINEs. We determined that SINEs retaining TSDs with perfect 5'-TT-AAAA nicking sites appear to be lost relatively rapidly from the human and rat genomes and less rapidly from dog. We speculate that the introduction of DNA breaks induced by recurring endonucleolytic attacks at these sites, combined with the ubiquitousness of SINEs, may significantly promote recombination between repetitive elements, leading to the observed losses. At the same time, new L1 subfamilies may be selected for "incompatibility" with preexisting targets. This provides a possible driving force for the continual emergence of new L1 subfamilies which, in turn, may affect selection of L1-dependent SINE subfamilies.},

abstract = {Background: The increasing amount of available genome sequence data enables large-scale comparative studies. A common task is the inference of phylogenies - a challenging task if close reference sequences are not available, genome sequences are incompletely assembled, or the high number of genomes precludes multiple sequence alignment in reasonable time. Results: We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. Conclusions: The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach. A comparison to other state-of-the-art whole-genome based methods indicates comparable or higher accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Abstract: Disease occurrence, clinical manifestations, and outcomes differ between men and women. Yet, women and men are most of the time treated similarly, which is often based on experimental data over-representing one sex. Accounting for persisting sex bias in biomedical research is the misconception that the analysis of sex-specific effects would double sample size and costs. We designed an analysis to test the potential benefits of a factorial study design in the context of a study including male and female animals. We chose a 2 × 2 factorial design approach to study the effect of treatment, sex, and an interaction term of treatment and sex in a hypothetical situation. We calculated the sample sizes required to detect an effect of a given magnitude with sufficient power and under different experimental setups. We demonstrated that the inclusion of both sexes in experimental setups, without testing for sex effects, requires no or few additional animals in our scenarios. These experimental designs still allow for the exploration of sex effects at low cost. In a confirmatory instead of an exploratory design, we observed an increase in total sample sizes by 33{\%}, at most. Since the complexities associated with this mathematical model require statistical expertise, we generated and provide a sample size calculator for planning factorial design experiments. For the inclusion of sex, a factorial design is advisable, and a sex-specific analysis can be performed without excessive additional effort. Our easy-to-use calculation tool provides help in designing studies with both sexes and addresses the current sex bias in preclinical studies. Key messages: • Both sexes should be included into animal studies. • Exploratory study of sex effects can be conducted with no or small increase in animal number. • Confirmatory analysis of sex effects requires maximum 33{\%} more animals per study. • Our calculation tool supports the design of studies with both sexes.},

abstract = {Introduction: Suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIBLEED) is a prevalent diagnosis in emergency departments. Despite existing gastroenterological and endoscopic scores to estimate the risk of GIBLEED, the primary clinical assessment remains challenging for both, emergency doctors and interventional gastroenterologists. The five step Manchester Triage System (MTS) is an easy to use and validated score that is often applied for the initial assessment of patient in emergency rooms (ER). The MTS classifies patients into five priority levels, ranging from level 1 (emergency, should receive immediate medical attention) to levels 2-5, corresponding to a suggested medical evaluation within 10, 30, 90, and 120 minutes, respectively. The MTS was established to manage clinical risk of administrating medical attention. The aim of our retrospective analyse was, to determine if the MTS correlates with presence of a GIBLEED. Methods: All patients who were admitted between January 2014 and December 2014 to our emergency department in a maximum care hospital (HSK Clinic Wiesbaden) were retrospectively analyzed. All relevant computer-based clinical patient records that included MTS priority levels were evaluated and associated with endoscopic findings. Results: In summary 5689 gastroenterologic emergencies were treated at our emergency room. 284 patients (4,9{\%}) (Mean age 64,3 years) were under suspicion of having GIBLEED. 47,5{\%} of these patients were introduced to the emergency service. among these, 162 patients (57,04{\%}) were admitted for immediate treatment. 160 patients (56,3{\%}) received endoscopic diagnostic. 33,1{\%} of patients who were transferred to the endoscopy by the emergency service team showed a confirmed endoscopic diagnosis of GIBLEED, compared to 49,1{\%} who were self-referring to the ER (p = 0.007). Endoscopic intervention for hemostasis was needed in 22 patients (13,8{\%}). The success rate of hemostasis was 96,6{\%}. While 61.2{\%} of all patients assigned to MTS levels 1, 2, and 3 received endoscopy, endoscopy rates in patients of levels 4 and 5 were only 26.3{\%} (p {\textless} 0.01). Gastrointestinal bleeding was endoscopically confirmed in 40{\%} of patients with level 1 to 2, 34{\%} in level 3 and 5.3{\%} level 4 to 5, which shows a significant correlation of MTS score and GIBLEED (p = 0.043, chi2 test). Conclusion: The MTS is an appropriate way to estimate the likelihood of GIBLEED for patients presenting in emergency departments. Patients at levels 1-3 should receive immediate endoscopic work up. Elective endoscopy can be performed in patients classified with levels 4-5. (Figure Presented).},

abstract = {Nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA sequences have been obtained from 64 strains of conjugating green algae (Zygnemophyceae, Streptophyta, Viridiplantae). Molecular phylogenetic analyses of 90 SSU rDNA sequences of Viridiplantae (inciuding 78 from the Zygnemophyceae) were performed using complex evolutionary models and maximum likelihood, distance, and maximum parsimony methods. The significance of the results was tested by bootstrap analyses, deletion of long-branch taxa, relative rate tests, and Kishino-Hasegawa tests with user-defined trees. All results support the monophyly of the class Zygnemophyceae and of the order Desmidiales. The second order, Zygnematales, forms a series of early-branching clades in paraphyletic succession, with the two traditional families Mesotaeniaceae and Zygnemataceae not recovered as lineages. Instead, a long-branch Spirogyra/Sirogonium clade and the later-diverging Netrium and Roya clades represent independent clades. Within the order Desmidiales, the families Gonatozygaceae and Closteriaceae are monophyletic, whereas the Peniaceae (represented only by Penium margaritaceum) and the Desmidiaceae represent a single weakly supported lineage. Within the Desmidiaceae short internal branches and varying rates of sequence evolution among taxa reduce the phylogenetic resolution significantly. The SSU rDNA-based phylogeny is largely congruent with a published analysis of the rbcL phylogeny of the Zygnemophyceae (McCourt et al. 2000) and is also in general agreement with classification schemes based on cell wall ultrastructure. The extended taxon sampling at the subgenus level provides solid evidence that many genera in the Zygnemophyceae are not monophyletic and that the genus concept in the group needs to be revised.},

abstract = {The standard approach for single-sequence RNA secondary structure prediction uses a nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model with several thousand experimentally determined energy parameters. An attractive alternative is to use statistical approaches with parameters estimated from growing databases of structural RNAs. Good results have been reported for discriminative statistical methods using complex nearest-neighbor models, including CONTRAfold, Simfold, and ContextFold. Little work has been reported on generative probabilistic models (stochastic context-free grammars [SCFGs]) of comparable complexity, although probabilistic models are generally easier to train and to use. To explore a range of probabilistic models of increasing complexity, and to directly compare probabilistic, thermodynamic, and discriminative approaches, we created TORNADO, a computational tool that can parse a wide spectrum of RNA grammar architectures (including the standard nearest-neighbor model and more) using a generalized super-grammar that can be parameterized with probabilities, energies, or arbitrary scores. By using TORNADO, we find that probabilistic nearest-neighbor models perform comparably to (but not significantly better than) discriminative methods. We find that complex statistical models are prone to overfitting RNA structure and that evaluations should use structurally nonhomologous training and test data sets. Overfitting has affected at least one published method (ContextFold). The most important barrier to improving statistical approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction is the lack of diversity of well-curated single-sequence RNA secondary structures in current RNA databases.},

abstract = {Background: The vast majority of the 1.1 million Alu elements are retrotranspositionally inactive, where only a few loci referred to as source elements can generate new Alu insertions. The first step in identifying the active Alu sources is to determine the loci transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). Previous genome-wide analyses from normal and transformed cell lines identified multiple Alu loci occupied by pol III factors, making them candidate source elements. Findings: Analysis of the data from these genome-wide studies determined that the majority of pol III-bound Alus belonged to the older subfamilies Alu S and Alu J, which varied between cell lines from 62.5{\%} to 98.7{\%} of the identified loci. The pol III-bound Alus were further scored for estimated retrotransposition potential (ERP) based on the absence or presence of selected sequence features associated with Alu retrotransposition capability. Our analyses indicate that most of the pol III-bound Alu loci candidates identified lack the sequence characteristics important for retrotransposition. Conclusions: These data suggest that Alu expression likely varies by cell type, growth conditions and transformation state. This variation could extend to where the same cell lines in different laboratories present different Alu expression patterns. The vast majority of Alu loci potentially transcribed by RNA pol III lack important sequence features for retrotransposition and the majority of potentially active Alu loci in the genome (scored high ERP) belong to young Alu subfamilies. Our observations suggest that in an in vivo scenario, the contribution of Alu activity on somatic genetic damage may significantly vary between individuals and tissues. {\textcopyright} 2012 Oler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {On the primate genome, a typical Alu element corresponds to a dimeric structure composed of two different but related monomeric sequences arranged in tandem. However, the analysis of primate sequences found in GenBank reveals the presence of free left and free right Alu elements. Here, we report the statistical study of those monomeric elements. We found that only a small fraction of them results from a deletion of a dimeric Alu sequence. The majority derives from the amplification of monomeric progenitor sequences and constitutes two families of monomeric elements: a family of free left Alu monomers that is composed of two subfamilies and a small family of free right Alu monomers. Both families predated the dimeric Alu elements, and a phylogetnetic analysis strongly suggests that the first progenitor of the dimeric Alu family arose through the fusion of a free left monomer with a free right monomer. {\textcopyright} 1992 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {The extent and biological impact of RNA cytosine methylation are poorly understood, in part owing to limitations of current techniques for determining the targets of RNA methyltransferases. Here we describe 5-azacytidine-mediated RNA immunoprecipitation (Aza-IP), a technique that exploits the covalent bond formed between an RNA methyltransferase and the cytidine analog 5-azacytidine to recover RNA targets by immunoprecipitation. Targets are subsequently identified by high-throughput sequencing. When applied in a human cell line to the RNA methyltransferases DNMT2 and NSUN2, Aza-IP enabled {\textgreater}200-fold enrichment of tRNAs that are known targets of the enzymes. In addition, it revealed many tRNA and noncoding RNA targets not previously associated with NSUN2. Notably, we observed a high frequency of C→G transversions at the cytosine residues targeted by both enzymes, allowing identification of the specific methylated cytosine(s) in target RNAs. Given the mechanistic similarity of RNA cytosine methyltransferases, Aza-IP may be generally applicable for target identification.},

abstract = {Acid mine drainage pollution may be associated with large water volume flows and exceptionally long periods of time over which the drainage may require treatment. While the use and role of sulphate reducing bacteria has been demonstrated in active treatment systems for acid mine drainage remediation, reactor size requirement and the cost and availability of the carbon and electron donor source are factors which constrain process development. Little attention has focussed on the use of waste stabilisation ponding processes for acid mine drainage treatment. Wastewater ponding is a mature technology for the treatment of large water volumes and its use as a basis for appropriate reactor design for acid mine drainage treatment is described including high rates of sulphate reduction and the precipitation of metal sulphides. Together with the co-disposal of organic wastes, algal biomass is generated as an independent carbon source for SRB production. Treatment of tannery effluent in a custom-designed high rate algal ponding process, and its use as a carbon source in the generation and precipitation of metal sulphides, has been demonstrated through piloting to the implementation of a full-scale process. The treatment of both mine drainage and zinc refinery wastewaters are reported. A complementary role for microalgal production in the generation of alkalinity and bioadsorptive removal of metals has been utilised and an Integrated 'Algal Sulphate Reducing Ponding Process for the Treatment of Acidic and Metal Wastewaters' (ASPAM) has been described.},

abstract = {Summary Background Several aquatic organisms such as loaches have evolved unique intestinal breathing mechanisms to survive under extensive hypoxia. To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange. Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus). Methods Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat. Findings Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level. A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications. Conclusions EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure. Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions.

abstract = {Structural variation (SV) plays an important role in genetic diversity among the population in general and specifically in diseases such as cancer. Modern next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide paired-end sequencing data at high depth with increasing read lengths. This development enabled the analysis of split-reads to detect SV breakpoints with single-nucleotide resolution. But ambiguous mappings and breakpoint sequences with further co-occurring mutations hamper split-read alignments against a reference sequence. The trade-off between high sensitivity and low false-positive rate is problematic and often requires a lot of fine-tuning of the analysis method based on knowledge about its algorithm and the characteristics of the data set. We present SoftSV, a method for exact breakpoint detection for small and large deletions, inversions, tandem duplications and inter-chromosomal translocations, which relies solely on the mutual alignment of soft-clipped reads within the neighborhood of discordantly mapped paired-end reads. Unlike other SV detection algorithms, our approach does not require thresholds regarding sequencing coverage or mapping quality. We evaluate SoftSV together with eight approaches (Breakdancer, Clever, CREST, Delly, GASVPro, Pindel, Socrates and SoftSearch) on simulated and real data sets. Our results show that sensitive and reliable SV detection is subject to many different factors like read length, sequence coverage and SV type. While most programs have their individual drawbacks, our greedy approach turns out to be the most robust and sensitive on many experimental setups. Sensitivities above 85{\%} and positive predictive values between 80 and 100{\%} could be achieved consistently for all SV types on simulated data sets starting at relatively short 75 bp reads and low 10–15× sequence coverage.},

These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosystems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory. In particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography. We also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a generalization of graph coloring. {\textcopyright} 1994, ACM. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Exome sequencing technologies have transformed the field of Mendelian genetics and allowed for efficient detection of genomic variants in protein-coding regions. The target enrichment process that is intrinsic to exome sequencing is inherently imperfect, generating large amounts of unintended off-target sequence. Off-target data are characterized by very low and highly heterogeneous coverage and are usually discarded by exome analysis pipelines. We posit that off-target read depth is a rich, but overlooked, source of information that could be mined to detect intergenic copy number variation (CNV). We propose cnvOffseq, a novel normalization framework for off-target read depth that is based on local adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). This method is designed to address the heterogeneity of the underlying data and allows for accurate and precise CNV detection and genotyping in off-target regions. RESULTS: cnvOffSeq was benchmarked on whole-exome sequencing samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. In a set of 104 gold standard intergenic deletions, our method achieved a sensitivity of 57.5{\%} and a specificity of 99.2{\%}, while maintaining a low FDR of 5{\%}. For gold standard deletions longer than 5 kb, cnvOffSeq achieves a sensitivity of 90.4{\%} without increasing the FDR. cnvOffSeq outperforms both whole-genome and whole-exome CNV detection methods considerably and is shown to offer a substantial improvement over naive local SVD. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: cnvOffSeq is available at http://sourceforge.net/p/cnvoffseq/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {We describe a semi-empirical framework that combines thermodynamic models of primer hybridization with experimentally determined elongation biases introduced by 3'-end mismatches for improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based sequence discrimination. The framework enables rational and automatic design of primers for optimal targeting of one or more sequences in ensembles of nearly identical DNA templates. In situations where optimal targeting is not feasible, the framework accurately predicts non-target sequences that are difficult to distinguish with PCR alone. Based on the synergistic effects of disparate sources of PCR bias, we used our framework to robustly distinguish between two alleles that differ by a single base pair. To demonstrate the applicability to environmental microbiology, we designed primers specific to all recognized archaeal and bacterial genera in the Ribosomal Database Project, and have made these primers available online. We applied these primers experimentally to obtain genus-specific amplification of 16S rRNA genes representing minor constituents of an environmental DNA sample. Our results demonstrate that inherent PCR biases can be reliably employed in an automatic fashion to maximize sequence discrimination and accurately identify potential cross-amplifications. We have made our framework accessible online as a programme for designing primers targeting one group of sequences in a set with many other sequences (http://DECIPHER.cee.wisc.edu).},

Studies have reported that targeted next-generation sequencing assays have the potential to identify such rearrangements; however, their utility in the clinical laboratory is unknown. We examine the sensitivity and specificity of ALK and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement detection by next-generation sequencing in the clinical laboratory. We analyzed a series of seven ALK rearranged cancers, six KMT2A rearranged leukemias, and 77 ALK/KMT2A rearrangement-negative cancers, previously tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Rearrangement detection was tested using publicly available software tools, including Breakdancer, ClusterFAST, CREST, and Hydra. Using Breakdancer and ClusterFAST, we detected ALK rearrangements in seven of seven FISH-positive cases and KMT2A rearrangements in six of six FISH-positive cases. Among the 77 ALK/KMT2A FISH-negative cases, no false-positive identifications were made by Breakdancer or ClusterFAST. Further, we identified one ALK rearranged case with a noncanonical intron 16 breakpoint, which is likely to affect its response to targeted inhibitors. We report that clinically relevant chromosomal rearrangements can be detected from targeted gene panel-based next-generation sequencing with sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of FISH while providing finer-scale information and increased efficiency for molecular oncology testing. ?? 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of DNA coding regions has become a common way of assaying genomic variation in the study of human diseases. Copy number variation (CNV) is an important type of genomic variation, but detecting and characterizing CNV from exome sequencing is challenging due to the high level of biases and artifacts. We propose CODEX, a normalization and CNV calling procedure for whole exome sequencing data. The Poisson latent factor model in CODEX includes terms that specifically remove biases due to GC content, exon capture and amplification efficiency, and latent systemic artifacts. CODEX also includes a Poisson likelihood-based recursive segmentation procedure that explicitly models the count-based exome sequencing data. CODEX is compared to existing methods on a population analysis of HapMap samples from the 1000 Genomes Project, and shown to be more accurate on three microarray-based validation data sets. We further evaluate performance on 222 neuroblastoma samples with matched normals and focus on a well-studied rare somatic CNV within the ATRX gene. We show that the cross-sample normalization procedure of CODEX removes more noise than normalizing the tumor against the matched normal and that the segmentation procedure performs well in detecting CNVs with nested structures.},

abstract = {To obtain rates of mRNA synthesis and decay in yeast, we established dynamic transcriptome analysis (DTA). DTA combines non-perturbing metabolic RNA labeling with dynamic kinetic modeling. DTA reveals that most mRNA synthesis rates are around several transcripts per cell and cell cycle, and most mRNA half-lives range around a median of 11 min. DTA can monitor the cellular response to osmotic stress with higher sensitivity and temporal resolution than standard transcriptomics. In contrast to monotonically increasing total mRNA levels, DTA reveals three phases of the stress response. During the initial shock phase, mRNA synthesis and decay rates decrease globally, resulting in mRNA storage. During the subsequent induction phase, both rates increase for a subset of genes, resulting in production and rapid removal of stress-responsive mRNAs. During the recovery phase, decay rates are largely restored, whereas synthesis rates remain altered, apparently enabling growth at high salt concentration. Stress-induced changes in mRNA synthesis rates are predicted from gene occupancy with RNA polymerase II. DTA-derived mRNA synthesis rates identified 16 stress-specific pairs/triples of cooperative transcription factors, of which seven were known. Thus, DTA realistically monitors the dynamics in mRNA metabolism that underlie gene regulatory systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Transcriptional profiling is a powerful approach for understanding development and disease. Current celltype-specific RNA purification methods have limitations, including cell dissociation trauma or inability to identify all RNA species. Here, we describe "mouse thiouracil (TU) tagging" a genetic and chemical intersectional method for covalent labeling and purification of cell type-specific RNA in vivo. Cre-induced expression of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) provides spatial specificity; injection of 4-thiouracil (4TU) provides temporal specificity. Only UPRT+ cells exposed to 4TU produce thio-RNA, which is then purified for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This method can purify transcripts from spatially complex and rare ({\textless}5{\%}) cells, such as Tie2:Cre+ brain endothelia/microglia (76{\%} validated by expression pattern), or temporally dynamic transcripts, such as those acutely induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Moreover, generating chimeric mice via UPRT+ bone marrow transplants identifies immune versus niche spleen RNA. TU tagging provides a novel method for identifying actively transcribed genes in specific cells at specific times within intact mice. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Mobile elements comprise close to one half of the mass of the human genome. Only LINE-1 (L1), an autonomous non-Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, and its non-autonomous partners-such as the retropseudogenes, SVA, and the SINE, Alu-are currently active human retroelements. Experimental evidence shows that Alu retrotransposition depends on L1 ORF2 protein, which has led to the presumption that LINEs and SINEs share the same basic insertional mechanism. Our data demonstrate clear differences in the time required to generate insertions between marked Alu and L1 elements. In our tissue culture system, the process of L1 insertion requires close to 48 hours. In contrast to the RNA pol II-driven L1, we find that pol III transcribed elements (Alu, the rodent SINE B2, and the 7SL, U6 and hY sequences) can generate inserts within 24 hours or less. Our analyses demonstrate that the observed retrotransposition timing does not dictate insertion rate and is independent of the type of reporter cassette utilized. The additional time requirement by L1 cannot be directly attributed to differences in transcription, transcript length, splicing processes, ORF2 protein production, or the ability of functional ORF2p to reach the nucleus. However, the insertion rate of a marked Alu transcript drastically drops when driven by an RNA pol II promoter (CMV) and the retrotransposition timing parallels that of L1. Furthermore, the "pol II Alu transcript" behaves like the processed pseudogenes in our retrotransposition assay, requiring supplementation with L1 ORF1p in addition to ORF2p. We postulate that the observed differences in retrotransposition kinetics of these elements are dictated by the type of RNA polymerase generating the transcript. We present a model that highlights the critical differences of LINE and SINE transcripts that likely define their retrotransposition timing. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA sequences and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA sequence data to reveal nested genetic population structures. We provide a direct interface to map the results from spatial clustering with Google Maps using the portal http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/ and illustrate this approach using sequence data from Borrelia burgdorferi. The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer.

abstract = {Contractile vacuoles (CVs) are essential for osmoregulation in many protists. To investigate the mechanism of CV function in Chlamydomonas, we isolated novel osmoregulatory mutants. Four of the isolated mutant cell lines carried the same 33,641 base deletion, rendering the cell lines unable to grow under strong hypotonic conditions. One mutant cell line (Osmo75) was analyzed in detail. The CV morphology was variable in mutant cells, and most cells had multiple small CVs. In addition, one or two enlarged CVs or no visible CVs at all, were observed by light microscopy. These findings suggest that the mutant is impaired in homotypic vacuolar and exocytotic membrane fusion. Furthermore the mutants had long flagella. One of the affected genes is the only SEC6 homologue in Chlamydomonas (CreSEC6). The SEC6 protein is a component of the exocyst complex that is required for efficient exocytosis. Transformation of the Osmo75 mutant with a CreSEC6-GFP construct rescued the mutant completely (osmoregulation and flagellar length). Rescued strains overexpressed CreSEC6 (as a GFP-tagged protein) and displayed a modified CV activity. CVs were larger, whereas the CV contraction interval remained unchanged, leading to increased water efflux rates. Electron microscopy analysis of Osmo75 cells showed that the mutant is able to form the close contact zones between the plasma membrane and the CV membrane observed during late diastole and systole. These results indicate that CreSEC6 is essential for CV function and required for homotypic vesicle fusion during diastole and water expulsion during systole. In addition, CreSEC6 is not only necessary for CV function, but possibly influences the CV cycle in an indirect manner and flagellar length in Chlamydomonas.},

abstract = {RNA editing by adenosine deamination generates RNA and protein diversity through the posttranscriptional modification of single nucleotides in RNA sequences. Few mammalian A-to-I edited genes have been identified despite evidence that many more should exist. Here we identify intramolecular pairs of Alu elements as a major target for editing in the human transcriptome. An experimental demonstration in 43 genes was extended by a broader computational analysis of more than 100,000 human mRNAs. We find that 1,445 human mRNAs (1.4{\%}) are subject to RNA editing at more than 14,500 sites, and our data further suggest that the vast majority of pre-mRNAs (greater than 85{\%}) are targeted in introns by the editing machinery. The editing levels of Alu-containing mRNAs correlate with distance and homology between inverted repeats and vary in different tissues. Alu-mediated RNA duplexes targeted by RNA editing are formed intramolecularly, whereas editing due to intermolecular base-pairing appears to be negligible. We present evidence that these editing events can lead to the posttranscriptional creation or elimination of splice signals affecting alternatively spliced Alu-derived exons. The analysis suggests that modification of repetitive elements is a predominant activity for RNA editing with significant implications for cellular gene expression.},

abstract = {Health care-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant organisms represents a major therapeutic challenge. Unfortunately, treatment is dependent on empirical therapy, which often leads to improper and inadequate antimicrobial therapy. A rapid multiplex PCR-based Unyvero pneumonia application (UPA) assay that assists in timely decision-making has recently become available. In this study, we evaluated the performance of UPA in detecting etiological pathogens and resistance markers in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The impact of this assay on the management of severe nosocomial pneumonia was also assessed. Appropriate specimens were processed by UPA according to the manufacturer's protocol in parallel with conventional culture methods. Of the 56 patients recruited into the study, 49 (87.5{\%}) were evaluable. Of these, 27 (55.1{\%}) and 4 (8.2{\%}) harbored multiple bacteria by the PCR assay and conventional culture, respectively. A single pathogen was detected in 8 (16.3{\%}) and 4 (8.2{\%}) patients, respectively. Thirteen different genes were detected from 38 patients, including the ermB gene (40.8{\%}), the blaOXA-51-like gene (28.6{\%}), the sul1 (28.6{\%}) and int1 (20.4{\%}) integrase genes, and the mecA and blaCTX-M genes (12.3{\%} each). The time from sample testing to results was 4 h versus 48 to 96 h by UPA and culture, respectively. Initial empirical treatment was changed within 5 to 6 h in 33 (67.3{\%}) patients based on the availability of UPA results. Thirty (62.2{\%}) of the patients improved clinically. A total of 3 (6.1{\%}) patients died, mainly from their comorbidities. These data demonstrate the potential of a multiplex PCR-based assay for accurate and timely detection of etiological agents of NP, multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and resistance markers, which can guide clinicians in making early antibiotic adjustments.},

This correlation was maintained in various subgroup analyses. A diagnostic change between iFR and other resting indexes occurred in three cases (3{\%}) when a fixed cut-off point (≤ 0.89) was applied. There was no diagnostic change when a hybrid zone (0.86 ≤ iFR ≤ 0.93) was considered. The new resting indexes and iFR showed very high correlation in real world practice.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microsatellite (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are widely used in plant breeding and genomic research. Thus, methods to improve the speed and efficiency of SSR and SNP genotyping are highly desirable. Here we describe a new method for multiplex PCR that facilitates fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for SNP assays. RESULTS: We show that multiplex-ready PCR can achieve a high (92{\%}) success rate for the amplification of published sequences under standardised reaction conditions, with a PCR specificity comparable to that of conventional PCR methods. We also demonstrate that multiplex-ready PCR supports an improved level of multiplexing in plant genomes of varying size and ploidy, without the need to carefully optimize assay conditions. Several advantages of multiplex-ready PCR for SSR and SNP genotyping are demonstrated and discussed. These include the uniform amplification of target sequences within multiplexed reactions and between independent assays, and the ability to label amplicons during PCR with specialised moieties such fluorescent dyes and biotin. CONCLUSION: Multiplex-ready PCR provides several technological advantages that can facilitate fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for SNP assays. These advantages can be captured at several points in the genotyping process, and offer considerable cost and labour savings. Multiplex-ready PCR is broadly applicable to plant genomics and marker assisted breeding, and should be transferable to any animal or plant species.},

abstract = {The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is controlled by day length in many plant species. Day length is perceived in leaves and induces a systemic signal, called florigen, that moves through the phloem to the shoot apex. At the shoot apical meristem (SAM), florigen causes changes in gene expression that reprogram the SAM to form flowers instead of leaves. Analysis of flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana placed the CONSTANS/FLOWERING LOCUS T (CO/FT) module at the core of a pathway that promotes flowering in response to changes in day length. We describe progress in defining the molecular mechanisms that activate this module in response to changing day length and the increasing evidence that FT protein is a major component of florigen. Finally, we discuss conservation of FT function in other species and how variation in its regulation could generate different flowering behaviors.},

abstract = {Of the ∼ 1.3 million Alu elements in the human genome, only a tiny number are estimated to be active in transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) III. Tracing the individual loci from which Alu transcripts originate is complicated by their highly repetitive nature. By exploiting RNA-Seq data sets and unique Alu DNA sequences, we devised a bioinformatic pipeline allowing us to identify Pol III-dependent transcripts of individual Alu elements. When applied to ENCODE transcriptomes of seven human cell lines, this search strategy identified ∼ 1300 Alu loci corresponding to detectable transcripts, with ∼ 120 of them expressed in at least three cell lines. In vitro transcription of selected Alus did not reflect their in vivo expression properties, and required the native 5'-flanking region in addition to internal promoter. We also identified a cluster of expressed AluYa5-derived transcription units, juxtaposed to snaR genes on chromosome 19, formed by a promoter-containing left monomer fused to an Alu-unrelated downstream moiety. Autonomous Pol III transcription was also revealed for Alus nested within Pol II-transcribed genes. The ability to investigate Alu transcriptomes at single-locus resolution will facilitate both the identification of novel biologically relevant Alu RNAs and the assessment of Alu expression alteration under pathological conditions.},

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

abstract = {The goal of The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium is to characterize human genome structural variation (SV), including forms of copy number variations (CNV) such as deletions, duplications, and insertions. Mobile element insertions (MEIs), particularly Alu elements, are major contributors to genomic structural variation among humans. During the pilot phase of the project we experimentally validated 645 (611 intergenic and 34 exon targeted) polymorphic "young" Alu insertion events, absent from the human reference genome. Here, we report high resolution sequencing of 343 (322 unique) recent Alu insertion events, along with their respective target site duplications, precise genomic breakpoint coordinates, subfamily assignment, percent divergence, and estimated A-rich tail lengths. All the sequenced Alu loci were derived from the AluY lineage with no evidence of retrotransposition activity involving older Alu families (e.g. AluJ and AluS). AluYa5 is currently the most active Alu subfamily in the human lineage, followed by AluYb8, and many others including three newly identified subfamilies we have termed AluYb7a3, AluYb8b1 and AluYa4a1. This report provides the structural details of 322 unique Alu variants from individual human genomes collectively adding about 100kb of genomic variation. Many Alu subfamilies are currently active in human populations, including a surprising level of AluY retrotransposition. Human Alu subfamilies exhibit continuous evolution with potential drivers sprouting new Alu lineages.},

GLIP cDNA had an 855-base pair open reading frame encoding a 30.5-kDa protein with 19-23{\%} amino acid identity to the water channels and 36{\%} identity to the bacterial glycerol facilitator GlpF. Northern blot analysis showed a 5.5-kilobase mRNA encoding GLIP in kidney, brain, and lung; RT-PCR/Southern blot analysis indicated expression of GLIP in kidney, brain, lung, eye, colon, stomach, and skeletal muscle, but not in heart, liver, and spleen. In situ hybridization in rat kidney showed GLIP mRNA expression in medullary collecting duct. Immunofluorescence with a peptide-derived polyclonal antibody showed GLIP protein expression in basolateral membrane of kidney collecting duct principal cells and brain meningeal cells. Functional measurements in Xenopus oocytes expressing GLIP cRNA showed a {\textgreater} 20-fold increase in [3H]glycerol uptake compared with water-injected oocytes; glycerol uptake was inhibited 88{\%} by diisothiocyanodisulfonic stilbene (0.2 mM) and 36{\%} by phloretin (0.25 mM). GLIP did not function as a transporter for water, urea, inositol, glucose, lactate, and monovalent ions. Glycerol uptake in oocytes expressing CHIP28 and MIWC was not different from that in water-injected controls. GLIP represents the first mammalian water channel homolog that selectively transports a solute other than water. The physiological substrate(s) and role(s) of GLIP remain to be elucidated.},

Here, we show that Alu elements resemble enhancers. Alu elements are bound by two well-phased nucleosomes that contain histones bearing marks of active chromatin, and they show tissue-specific enrichment for the enhancer mark H3K4me1. A proportion of Alu elements were experimentally validated as bona fide active enhancers with an invitro reporter assay. In addition, Hi-C data indicate that Alus show long-range interactions with gene promoters. We also find that Alus are generally more conserved when located in the proximal upstream region of genes. Their similarity to enhancers becomes more prominent with their age in the human genome, following a clear evolutionary continuum reminiscent of the evolutionary pattern of proto-genes. Therefore, we conclude that some Alu elements can function as enhancers and propose that many more may be proto-enhancers that serve as a repertoire for the de novo birth of enhancers. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

@article{Caisova2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The second Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS2) is a fast evolving part of the nuclear-encoded rRNA operon located between the 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes. Based on crossing experiments it has been proposed that even a single Compensatory Base Change (CBC) in helices 2 and 3 of the ITS2 indicates sexual incompatibility and thus separates biological species. Taxa without any CBC in these ITS2 regions were designated as a 'CBC clade'. However, in depth comparative analyses of ITS2 secondary structures, ITS2 phylogeny, the origin of CBCs, and their relationship to biological species have rarely been performed. To gain 'close-up' insights into ITS2 evolution, (1) 86 sequences of ITS2 including secondary structures have been investigated in the green algal order Ulvales (Chlorophyta, Viridiplantae), (2) after recording all existing substitutions, CBCs and hemi-CBCs (hCBCs) were mapped upon the ITS2 phylogeny, rather than merely comparing ITS2 characters among pairs of taxa, and (3) the relation between CBCs, hCBCs, CBC clades, and the taxonomic level of organisms was investigated in detail.

RESULTS: High sequence and length conservation allowed the generation of an ITS2 consensus secondary structure, and introduction of a novel numbering system of ITS2 nucleotides and base pairs. Alignments and analyses were based on this structural information, leading to the following results: (1) in the Ulvales, the presence of a CBC is not linked to any particular taxonomic level, (2) most CBC 'clades' sensu Coleman are paraphyletic, and should rather be termed CBC grades. (3) the phenetic approach of pairwise comparison of sequences can be misleading, and thus, CBCs/hCBCs must be investigated in their evolutionary context, including homoplasy events (4) CBCs and hCBCs in ITS2 helices evolved independently, and we found no evidence for a CBC that originated via a two-fold hCBC substitution.

CONCLUSIONS: Our case study revealed several discrepancies between ITS2 evolution in the Ulvales and generally accepted assumptions underlying ITS2 evolution as e.g. the CBC clade concept. Therefore, we developed a suite of methods providing a critical 'close-up' view into ITS2 evolution by directly tracing the evolutionary history of individual positions, and we caution against a non-critical use of the ITS2 CBC clade concept for species delimitation.},

Here, we predicted 18S rRNA primers based on consecutive conserved sites and evaluated their coverage efficiency and scope of application to different eukaryotic groups. After evaluation, eight of them were considered as qualified 18S primers based on coverage rate. Next, we examined common conserved regions in prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences to design 16S/18S universal primers. Three 16S/18S candidate primers, U515, U1390 and U1492, were then considered to be suitable for simultaneous amplification of the rRNA sequences in three domains. Eukaryotic 18S and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes in a sponge were amplified simultaneously using universal primers U515 and U1390, and the subsequent sorting of pyrosequenced reads revealed some distinctive communities in different parts of the sample. The real difference in biodiversity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts could be discerned as the dissimilarity between OTUs was increased from 0.005 to 0.1. A network of the communities in external and internal parts of the sponge illustrated the co-variation of some unique microbes in certain parts of the sponge, suggesting that the universal primers are useful in simultaneous detection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities.},

Here, we depleted different proteins that act in nuclear export in human cells and quantified the transcriptome-wide consequences on RNA localization. Different genes exhibited substantially variable sensitivities, with depletion of NXF1 and TREX components causing some transcripts to become strongly retained in the nucleus while others were not affected. Specifically, NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U content, whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts. Using massively parallel reporter assays, we identified short sequence elements that render transcripts dependent on NXF1 for their export and identified synergistic effects of splicing and NXF1. These results revise the current model of how nuclear export shapes the distribution of RNA within human cells.},

It is a challenge to disentangle processes occurring on complementary strands of the same genomic region. We present the double-stranded HMM (dsHMM), a model for the strand-specific analysis of genomic processes. We applied dsHMM to yeast using strand specific transcription data, nucleosome data, and protein binding data for a set of 11 factors associated with the regulation of transcription.The resulting annotation recovers the mRNA transcription cycle (initiation, elongation, termination) while correctly predicting strand-specificity and directionality of the transcription process. We find that pre-initiation complex formation is an essentially undirected process, giving rise to a large number of bidirectional promoters and to pervasive antisense transcription. Notably, 12{\%} of all transcriptionally active positions showed simultaneous activity on both strands. Furthermore, dsHMM reveals that antisense transcription is specifically suppressed by Nrd1, a yeast termination factor.},

Trichosporon japonicum was isolated from the air and named by Sugita et al. Here we present the first case of T. japonicum isolated from a clinical specimen. Two cases of acute myeloid leukemia who had Trichosporon isolates are discussed because of their rarity and growing importance. T. asahii was isolated from the throat, feces and urine of the first patient. T. japonicum was isolated from the sputum of the second patient. Both cases produced high MICs to itraconazole, and low MICs to fluconazole and voriconazole. In virulance factor investigations there was (++) biofilm formation in T. japonicum but not in T. asahii. Conventional mycological studies were not adequate for the identification of the isolate at the species level. In our second case as in the first one, the isolate was identified as T. asahii with 99.9{\%} accuracy by API 20C AUX. Although two T. asahii isolates from the same patient yielded identical typing profiles by arbitrary primed-PCR, the isolates of the two different patients showed different arbitrary primed-PCR typing profiles. However, the genetic identification of the other patient's strain gave the result of T. japonicum.},

abstract = {Alu elements are the most successful transposons in humans. They are 300-bp non-coding sequences transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and are expected to retrotranspose with the aid of reverse transcriptases of cellular origin. We previously showed that human LINEs can generate cDNA copies of any mRNA transcript by means of a retroposition process involving reverse transcription and integration by the LINE-encoded endonuclease and reverse transcriptase. Here we show mobility of marked Alu sequences in human HeLa cells with the canonical features of a retrotransposition process, including splicing out of an autocatalytic intron introduced into the marked sequence, target site duplications of varying lengths and integrations into consensus A-rich sequences. We further show that the poly-A stretch at the Alu 3′ end is essential for mobility, that LINEs are required for transposition and that the rate of retroposition is 100-1,000 times higher for Alu transcripts than for control mRNAs, thus accounting for the high mutational activity of these elements observed in humans.},

abstract = {Similar to tRNA genes and the VAI gene, the Alu family repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and contain a split intragenic promoter. Results of our previous studies have shown that when the anterior, box A-containing promoter element (5'-Pu-Pu-Py-N-N-Pu-Pu-Py-G-G-3' in which Pu is any purine, Py is any pyrimidine, and N is any nucleotide) of a human Alu family repeat is deleted, the remaining box B-containing promoter element (5'-G-A/T-T-C-Pu-A-N-N-C-3') is still capable of directing weak transcriptional initiation at approximately 70 base pairs (bp) upstream from the box B sequence. This is different from the tRNA genes in which the box A-containing promoter element plays the major role in the positioning of the transcriptional initiation site(s). To account for this difference, we first carried out competition experiments in which we show that the posterior element of the Alu repeat competes with the VAI gene effectively for the transcription factor C in HeLa cell extracts. We then constructed a series of contraction and expansion mutants of the Alu repeat promoter in which the spacing between boxes A and B was systematically varied by molecular cloning. In vitro transcription of these clones in HeLa cell extracts was analyzed by RNA gel electrophoresis and primer extension mapping. We show that when the box A and box B promoter sequences are separated by 47 to 298 bp, the transcriptional initiation sites remain 4 to 5 bp upstream from box A. However, this positioning function by the box A-containing promoter element was lost when the spacing was shortened to only 26 bp or increased to longer than 600 bp. Instead, transcriptional initiation occurred approximately 70 bp upstream from box B, similar to that in the clones containing only the box B promoter element. All the mutant clones were transcribed less efficiently than was the wild type. An increase in the distance between boxes A and B also activated a second box A-like element within the Alu family repeat. We compare these results with the results of tRNA gene studies. We also discuss this comparison in terms of the positioning function of the split class III promoter elements and the evolutionary conservation of the spacing between the two promoter elements for optimum transcriptional efficiency.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license. DNA replication, transcription and repair involve the recruitment of protein complexes that change their composition as they progress along the genome in a directed or strand-specific manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in conjunction with hidden Markov models (HMMs) has been instrumental in understanding these processes, as they segment the genome into discrete states that can be related to DNA-associated protein complexes. However, current HMM-based approaches are not able to assign forward or reverse direction to states or properly integrate strand-specific (e.g., RNA expression) with non-strand-specific (e.g., ChIP) data, which is indispensable to accurately characterize directed processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce bidirectional HMMs which infer directed genomic states from occupancy profiles de novo. Application to RNA polymerase II-associated factors in yeast and chromatin modifications in human T cells recovers the majority of transcribed loci, reveals gene-specific variations in the yeast transcription cycle and indicates the existence of directed chromatin state patterns at transcribed, but not at repressed, regions in the human genome. In yeast, we identify 32 new transcribed loci, a regulated initiation-elongation transition, the absence of elongation factors Ctk1 and Paf1 from a class of genes, a distinct transcription mechanism for highly expressed genes and novel DNA sequence motifs associated with transcription termination. We anticipate bidirectional HMMs to significantly improve the analyses of genome-associated directed processes. Synopsis Bidirectional hidden Markov models improve the annotation of DNA-associated processes from genomics data, reveal variations in the yeast Pol II transcription cycle and identify directed chromatin state patterns at transcribed regions in the human genome. Genomic feature annotations derived from bidirectional hidden Markov models are up to twice as accurate compared to those from standard hidden Markov models. Variations in the yeast Pol II transcription cycle fall into clusters of co-regulated genes, whose functional categories range from housekeeping and cell cycle to stress response. New insights into transcriptional regulation are obtained, indicating a regulated initiation-elongation transition and a distinct transcription mechanism for highly expressed genes. An implementation of bidirectional hidden Markov models is freely available at the Bioconductor website: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/STAN.html.

abstract = {Bulk-tissue RNA-Seq is increasingly being used in the study of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the kidney; however, the presence of multiple cell types in kidney tissue complicates data interpretation. We addressed the question of which cell types are represented in whole-kidney RNA-Seq data in order to identify circumstances in which bulk-kidney RNA-Seq can be successfully interpreted. We carried out RNA-Seq in mouse whole kidneys and in microdissected renal tubule segments. To aid in the interpretation of the data, we compiled a database of cell-type selective protein markers for 43 cell types believed to be present in kidney tissue. The whole-kidney RNA-Seq analysis identified transcripts corresponding to 17,742 genes, distributed over 5 orders of magnitude of expression level. Markers for all 43 curated cell types were detectable. Analysis of the cellular makeup of mouse and rat kidney, calculated from published literature, suggests that proximal tubule cells account for more than half of the mRNA in a kidney. Comparison of RNA-Seq data from microdissected proximal tubules with data from whole kidney supports this view. RNA-Seq data for cell-type selective markers in bulk-kidney samples provide a valid means to identify changes in minority-cell abundances in kidney tissue. Because proximal tubules make up a substantial fraction of whole-kidney samples, changes in proximal tubule gene expression can be assessed presumptively by bulk-kidney RNA-Seq, although results could potentially be complicated by the presence of mRNA from other cell types.},

Despite their being genetically functionless, recent findings suggest that Alu elements may have a broad evolutionary impact by affecting gene structures, protein sequences, splicing motifs and expression patterns. Because of these effects, compiling a genomic database of Alu sequences that reside within protein-coding genes seemed a useful enterprise. Presently, such data are limited since the structural and positional information on genes and Alu sequences are scattered throughout incompatible and unconnected databases. AluGene (http://Alugene.tau.ac.il/) provides easy access to a complete Alu map of the human genome, as well as Alu-associated information. The Alu elements are annotated with respect to coding region and exon/intron location. This design facilitates queries on Alu sequences, locations, as well as motifs and compositional properties via a one-stop search page.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiplex PCR, defined as the simultaneous amplification of multiple regions of a DNA template or multiple DNA templates using more than one primer set (comprising a forward primer and a reverse primer) in one tube, has been widely used in diagnostic applications of clinical and environmental microbiology studies. However, primer design for multiplex PCR is still a challenging problem and several factors need to be considered. These problems include mis-priming due to nonspecific binding to non-target DNA templates, primer dimerization, and the inability to separate and purify DNA amplicons with similar electrophoretic mobility.

RESULTS: A program named MPprimer was developed to help users for reliable multiplex PCR primer design. It employs the widely used primer design program Primer3 and the primer specificity evaluation program MFEprimer to design and evaluate the candidate primers based on genomic or transcript DNA database, followed by careful examination to avoid primer dimerization. The graph-expanding algorithm derived from the greedy algorithm was used to determine the optimal primer set combinations (PSCs) for multiplex PCR assay. In addition, MPprimer provides a virtual electrophotogram to help users choose the best PSC. The experimental validation from 2x to 5x plex PCR demonstrates the reliability of MPprimer. As another example, MPprimer is able to design the multiplex PCR primers for DMD (dystrophin gene which caused Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), which has 79 exons, for 20x, 20x, 20x, 14x, and 5x plex PCR reactions in five tubes to detect underlying exon deletions.

CONCLUSIONS: MPprimer is a valuable tool for designing specific, non-dimerizing primer set combinations with constrained amplicons size for multiplex PCR assays.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes are punctuated by a multitude of tiny genetic elements, that share the property of being recognized and transcribed by the RNA polymerase (Pol) III machinery to produce a variety of small, abundant non-protein-coding (nc) RNAs (tRNAs, 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA and many others). The highly selective, efficient and localized action of Pol III at its minute genomic targets is made possible by a handful of cis-acting regulatory elements, located within the transcribed region (where they are bound by the multisubunit assembly factor TFIIIC) and/or upstream of the transcription start site. Most of them participate directly or indirectly in the ultimate recruitment of TFIIIB, a key multiprotein initiation factor able to direct, once assembled, multiple transcription cycles by Pol III. But the peculiar efficiency and selectivity of Pol III transcription also depends on its ability to recognize very simple and precisely positioned termination signals. Studies in the last few years have significantly expanded the set of known Pol III-associated loci in genomes and, concomitantly, have revealed unexpected features of Pol III cis-regulatory elements in terms of variety, function, genomic location and potential contribution to transcriptome complexity. Here we review, in a historical perspective, well established and newly acquired knowledge about Pol III transcription control elements, with the aim of providing a useful reference for future studies of the Pol III system, which we anticipate will be numerous and intriguing for years to come. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background Mutations in the transcription factor SOX18 are responsible for specific cardiovascular defects in humans and mice. In order to gain insight into the molecular basis of its action, we identified target genes of SOX18 and analyzed one, MMP7, in detail.   Methodology/Principal Findings SOX18 was expressed in HUVEC using a recombinant adenoviral vector and the altered gene expression profile was analyzed using microarrays. Expression of several regulated candidate SOX18 target genes was verified by real-time PCR. Knock-down of SOX18 using RNA interference was then used to confirm the effect of the transcription factor on selected genes that included the guidance molecules ephrin B2 and semaphorin 3G. One gene, MMP7, was chosen for further analysis, including detailed promoter studies using reporter gene assays, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealing that it responds directly to SOX18. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the co-expression of SOX18 and MMP7 in blood vessels of human skin.   Conclusions/Significance The identification of MMP7 as a direct SOX18 target gene as well as other potential candidates including guidance molecules provides a molecular basis for the proposed function of this transcription factor in the regulation of vessel formation.},

Here, we propose a method termed 'mixed random forest' that simultaneously accounts for population structure and captures nonlinear genetic effects. We test the model in simulation experiments and show that the mixed random forest approach improves detection power compared with established approaches. In an application to data from an outbred mouse population, we find that mixed random forest identifies associations that are more consistent with prior knowledge than competing methods. Further, our approach allows predicting phenotypes from genotypes with greater accuracy than any of the other methods that we tested. Our results show that approaches that simultaneously account for both, confounding due to population structure and epistatic interactions, are important to fully explain the heritable component of complex quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression depends on the cooperation of multiple mechanisms, including the functional interaction of promoters with distally located enhancers. Here, we show that, in cortical neurons, a subset of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) located in the proximity of activity-regulated genes bears features of enhancers. Enhancer SINEs (eSINEs) recruit the Pol III cofactor complex TFIIIC in a stimulus-dependent manner and are transcribed by Pol III in response to neuronal depolarization. Characterization of an eSINE located in proximity to the Fos gene (FosRSINE1) indicated that the FosRSINE1-encoded transcript interacts with Pol II at the Fos promoter and mediates Fos relocation to Pol II factories, providing an unprecedented molecular link between Pol III and Pol II transcription. Strikingly, knockdown of the FosRSINE1 transcript induces defects of both cortical radial migration in vivo and activity-dependent dendritogenesis in vitro, demonstrating that FosRSINE1 acts as a strong enhancer of Fos expression in diverse physiological contexts. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression requires the interaction between promoters and distally located enhancers. Policarpi et al. identify a subset of SINEs that functions as enhancers for activity-dependent neuronal genes. The enhancer SINE FosRSINE1 regulates Fos transcription and is necessary for both activity-dependent dendritogenesis and proper brain development.},

abstract = {Motivation: Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}100 kilo bases (kb) in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 mega bases (Mb) in length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms. Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of {\$}\backslashge{\$}100bp in length, {\$}\backslashge{\$}1kb genomic reads at error rate {\$}\backslashsim{\$}15{\%}, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads, and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions (INDELs) and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times faster than mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy and {\$}\backslashge{\$}30 times faster at higher accuracy for both genomic and mRNA reads, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

EU-labeled cellular RNA is detected quickly and with high sensitivity by using a copper (I)-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction (often referred to as "click" chemistry) with fluorescent azides, followed by microscopic imaging. We demonstrate the use of this method in cultured cells, in which we examine the turnover of bulk RNA after EU pulses of varying lengths. We also use EU to assay transcription rates of various tissues in whole animals, both on sections and by whole-mount staining. We find that total transcription rates vary greatly among different tissues and among different cell types within organs.},

SMA is caused by a ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein-the key component of a macromolecular machine essential for the assembly of diverse RNA-protein complexes that participate in various aspects of RNA processing and posttranscriptional gene regulation. The identification of the full spectrum of RNA-processing pathways directly controlled by SMN and dissection of the downstream consequences of SMN deficiency on RNA regulation that impact motor system function are fundamental steps toward understanding disease mechanisms. This chapter discusses how advances in our understanding of the functions of SMN and the effects of RNA-processing dysregulation induced by SMN deficiency are helping to unravel the molecular basis of SMA.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been a great success and is now a standard method of research in the life sciences. With this technology, dozens of whole genomes or hundreds of exomes can be sequenced in rather short time, producing huge amounts of data. Complex bioinformatics analyses are required to turn these data into scientific findings. In order to run these analyses fast, automated workflows implemented on high performance computers are state of the art. While providing sufficient compute power and storage to meet the NGS data challenge, high performance computing (HPC) systems require special care when utilized for high throughput processing. This is especially true if the HPC system is shared by different users. Here, stability, robustness and maintainability are as important for automated workflows as speed and throughput.

abstract = {Precise and efficient mapping of epigenetic markers on DNA may become an important clinical tool for prediction and identification of ailments. Methylated CpG sites are involved in gene expression and are biomarkers for diseases such as cancer. Here, we use the engineered biological protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) to detect and map 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine within single strands of DNA. In this unique single-molecule tool, a phi29 DNA polymerase draws ssDNA through the pore in single-nucleotide steps, and the ion current through the pore is recorded. Comparing current levels generated with DNA containing methylated CpG sites to current levels obtained with unmethylated copies of the DNA reveals the precise location of methylated CpG sites. Hydroxymethylation is distinct from methylation and can also be mapped. With a single read, the detection efficiency in a quasirandom DNA strand is 97.5 ± 0.7{\%} for methylation and 97 ± 0.9{\%} for hydroxymethylation.},

However, to what extent cellular heterogeneity exists within healthy glomerular cell populations remains unknown. Methods We used nanodroplet-based highly parallel transcriptional profiling to characterize the cellular content of purified wild-type mouse glomeruli. Results Unsupervised clustering of nearly 13,000 single-cell transcriptomes identified the three known glomerular cell types. We provide a comprehensive online atlas of gene expression in glomerular cells that can be queried and visualized using an interactive and freely available database. Novel marker genes for all glomerular cell types were identified and supported by immunohistochemistry images obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. Subclustering of endothelial cells revealed a subset of endothelium that expressed marker genes related to endothelial proliferation. By comparison, the podocyte population appeared more homogeneous but contained three smaller, previously unknown subpopulations. Conclusions Our study comprehensively characterized gene expression in individual glomerular cells and sets the stage for the dissection of glomerular function at the single-cell level in health and disease.},

abstract = {Variation in life history contributes to reproductive success in different environments. Divergence of annual and perennial angiosperm species is an extreme example that has occurred frequently. Perennials survive for several years and restrict the duration of reproduction by cycling between vegetative growth and flowering, whereas annuals live for 1 year and flower once. We used the tribe Arabideae (Brassicaceae) to study the divergence of seasonal flowering behaviour among annual and perennial species. In perennial Brassicaceae, orthologues of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a floral inhibitor in Arabidopsis thaliana, are repressed by winter cold and reactivated in spring conferring seasonal flowering patterns, whereas in annuals, they are stably repressed by cold. We isolated FLC orthologues from three annual and two perennial Arabis species and found that the duplicated structure of the A. alpina locus is not required for perenniality. The expression patterns of the genes differed between annuals and perennials, as observed among Arabidopsis species, suggesting a broad relevance of these patterns within the Brassicaceae. Also analysis of plants derived from an interspecies cross of A. alpina and annual A. montbretiana demonstrated that cis-regulatory changes in FLC orthologues contribute to their different transcriptional patterns. Sequence comparisons of FLC orthologues from annuals and perennials in the tribes Arabideae and Camelineae identified two regulatory regions in the first intron whose sequence variation correlates with divergence of the annual and perennial expression patterns. Thus, we propose that related cis-acting changes in FLC orthologues occur independently in different tribes of the Brassicaceae during life history evolution.},

abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift.

abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown thai the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.

@article{Hochreiter2007,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: As more genomes are sequenced, the demand for fast gene classification techniques is increasing. To analyze a newly sequenced genome, first the genes are identified and translated into amino acid sequences which are then classified into structural or functional classes. The best-performing protein classification methods are based on protein homology detection using sequence alignment methods. Alignment methods have recently been enhanced by discriminative methods like support vector machines (SVMs) as well as by position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) as obtained from PSI-BLAST. However, alignment methods are time consuming if a new sequence must be compared to many known sequences-the same holds for SVMs. Even more time consuming is to construct a PSSM for the new sequence. The best-performing methods would take about 25 days on present-day computers to classify the sequences of a new genome (20,000 genes) as belonging to just one specific class--however, there are hundreds of classes. Another shortcoming of alignment algorithms is that they do not build a model of the positive class but measure the mutual distance between sequences or profiles. Only multiple alignments and hidden Markov models are popular classification methods which build a model of the positive class but they show low classification performance. The advantage of a model is that it can be analyzed for chemical properties common to the class members to obtain new insights into protein function and structure. We propose a fast model-based recurrent neural network for protein homology detection, the 'Long Short-Term Memory' (LSTM). LSTM automatically extracts indicative patterns for the positive class, but in contrast to profile methods it also extracts negative patterns and uses correlations between all detected patterns for classification. LSTM is capable to automatically extract useful local and global sequence statistics like hydrophobicity, polarity, volume, polarizability and combine them with a pattern. These properties make LSTM complementary to alignment-based approaches as it does not use predefined similarity measures like BLOSUM or PAM matrices. RESULTS: We have applied LSTM to a well known benchmark for remote protein homology detection, where a protein must be classified as belonging to a SCOP superfamily. LSTM reaches state-of-the-art classification performance but is considerably faster for classification than other approaches with comparable classification performance. LSTM is five orders of magnitude faster than methods which perform slightly better in classification and two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest SVM-based approaches (which, however, have lower classification performance than LSTM). Only PSI-BLAST and HMM-based methods show comparable time complexity as LSTM, but they cannot compete with LSTM in classification performance. To test the modeling capabilities of LSTM, we applied LSTM to PROSITE classes and interpreted the extracted patterns. In 8 out of 15 classes, LSTM automatically extracted the PROSITE motif. In the remaining 7 cases alternative motifs are generated which give better classification results on average than the PROSITE motifs. AVAILABILITY: The LSTM algorithm is available from http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/LSTM{\_}protein/.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples.

RESULTS: During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67{\%}). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) also named aquaporins form channels facilitating the passive transport of water and other small polar molecules across membranes. MIPs are particularly abundant and diverse in terrestrial plants but little is known about their evolutionary history. In an attempt to investigate the origin of the plant MIP subfamilies, genomes of chlorophyte algae, the sister group of charophyte algae and land plants, were searched for MIP encoding genes.

RESULTS: A total of 22 MIPs were identified in the nine analysed genomes and phylogenetic analyses classified them into seven subfamilies. Two of these, Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) and GlpF-like Intrinsic Proteins (GIPs), are also present in land plants and divergence dating support a common origin of these algal and land plant MIPs, predating the evolution of terrestrial plants. The subfamilies unique to algae were named MIPA to MIPE to facilitate the use of a common nomenclature for plant MIPs reflecting phylogenetically stable groups. All of the investigated genomes contained at least one MIP gene but only a few species encoded MIPs belonging to more than one subfamily.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that at least two of the seven subfamilies found in land plants were present already in an algal ancestor. The total variation of MIPs and the number of different subfamilies in chlorophyte algae is likely to be even higher than that found in land plants. Our analyses indicate that genetic exchanges between several of the algal subfamilies have occurred. The PIP1 and PIP2 groups and the Ca2+ gating appear to be specific to land plants whereas the pH gating is a more ancient characteristic shared by all PIPs. Further studies are needed to discern the function of the algal specific subfamilies MIPA-E and to fully understand the evolutionary relationship of algal and terrestrial plant MIPs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) generate millions of reads and hundreds of datasets, and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and distill such large amounts of data. Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the NGS and GWAS. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).

RESULTS: We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis (IPAD, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources.IPAD is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the BioCarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature curated, Reactome, CTD, PharmGKB, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and HOMER. The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ.Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.

CONCLUSIONS: IPAD is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current IPAD database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.},

@article{Gaudet2011,
abstract = {The goal of the Gene Ontology (GO) project is to provide a uniform way to describe the functions of gene products from organisms across all kingdoms of life and thereby enable analysis of genomic data. Protein annotations are either based on experiments or predicted from protein sequences. Since most sequences have not been experimentally characterized, most available annotations need to be based on predictions. To make as accurate inferences as possible, the GO Consortium's Reference Genome Project is using an explicit evolutionary framework to infer annotations of proteins from a broad set of genomes from experimental annotations in a semi-automated manner. Most components in the pipeline, such as selection of sequences, building multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, retrieving experimental annotations and depositing inferred annotations, are fully automated. However, the most crucial step in our pipeline relies on software-assisted curation by an expert biologist. This curation tool, Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool (PAINT) helps curators to infer annotations among members of a protein family. PAINT allows curators to make precise assertions as to when functions were gained and lost during evolution and record the evidence (e.g. experimentally supported GO annotations and phylogenetic information including orthology) for those assertions. In this article, we describe how we use PAINT to infer protein function in a phylogenetic context with emphasis on its strengths, limitations and guidelines. We also discuss specific examples showing how PAINT annotations compare with those generated by other highly used homology-based methods.},

abstract = {Regulatory networks composed of interacting genes are responsible for pattern formation and cell type specification in a wide variety of developmental contexts. Evolution must act on these regulatory networks in order to change the proportions, distribution, and characteristics of specified cells. Thus, understanding how these networks operate in homologous systems across multiple levels of phylogenetic divergence is critical for understanding the evolution of developmental systems. Among the most thoroughly characterized regulatory networks is the dorsal-ventral patterning system of the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Due to the thorough understanding of this system, it is an ideal starting point for comparative analyses. Here we report an analysis of the DV patterning system of the wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. This wasp undergoes a mode of long germ embryogenesis that is superficially nearly identical to that of Drosophila, but one that was likely independently derived. We have found that while the expression of genes just prior to the onset of gastrulation is almost identical in Nasonia and Drosophila, both the upstream network responsible for generating this pattern, and the downstream morphogenetic movements that it sets in motion, are significantly diverged. From this we conclude that many network structures are available to evolution to achieve particular developmental ends.},

Introduction of mutations that can convert H1 serotype HAs to human alpha2-6 receptor specificity only enhanced or reduced affinity for avian-type receptors. However, mutations that can convert avian H2 and H3 HAs to human receptor specificity, when inserted onto the Viet04 H5 HA framework, permitted binding to a natural human alpha2-6 glycan, which suggests a path for this H5N1 virus to gain a foothold in the human population.},

abstract = {High throughput sequencing technologies have become essential in studies on genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. Although sequencing information has traditionally been elucidated using a low throughput technique called Sanger sequencing, high throughput sequencing technologies are capable of sequencing multiple DNA molecules in parallel, enabling hundreds of millions of DNA molecules to be sequenced at a time. This advantage allows high throughput sequencing to be used to create large data sets, generating more comprehensive insights into the cellular genomic and transcriptomic signatures of various diseases and developmental stages. Within high throughput sequencing technologies, whole exome sequencing can be used to identify novel variants and other mutations that may underlie many genetic cardiac disorders, whereas RNA sequencing can be used to analyze how the transcriptome changes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and methylation sequencing can be used to identify epigenetic changes, whereas ribosome sequencing can be used to determine which mRNA transcripts are actively being translated. In this review, we will outline the differences in various sequencing modalities and examine the main sequencing platforms on the market in terms of their relative read depths, speeds, and costs. Finally, we will discuss the development of future sequencing platforms and how these new technologies may improve on current sequencing platforms. Ultimately, these sequencing technologies will be instrumental in further delineating how the cardiovascular system develops and how perturbations in DNA and RNA can lead to cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of the taxonomically informative 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene provides a powerful approach for exploring microbial diversity. Here we compare the performance of two common "benchtop" sequencing platforms, Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM, for bacterial community profiling by 16S rRNA (V1-V2) amplicon sequencing. We benchmark performance using a 20-organism mock bacterial community and a collection of primary human specimens. We observed comparatively higher error rates from the Ion Torrent platform and report a pattern of premature sequence truncation specific to semiconductor sequencing. Read truncation was dependent both on directionality of sequencing and the target species, resulting in organism-specific biases in community profiles. We found that these sequencing artifacts could be minimized using bidirectional amplicon sequencing and an optimized flow order on the Ion Torrent platform. Bacterial community profiling performed on the mock community and a collection of 18 human-derived microbiological specimens were generally in good agreement for both platforms; however, in some cases results differed significantly. Disparities could be attributed to the failure to generate full-length reads for particular organisms on the Ion Torrent platform, organism-dependent differences in sequence error rates affecting classification of certain species, or some combination of these factors. This study demonstrates the potential for differential bias in bacterial community profiles resulting from the choice of sequencing platforms alone.},

Repetitive sequence classes are distributed throughout 80{\%} or more of the genome. Slightly more than half of the genome consists of short single copy sequences, with a length of about 2 kb interspersed with repetitive sequences. The average length of the repetitive sequences is also small and approximates the length of these sequences found in other organisms. The sequence organization of the human genome therefore resembles the sequence organization found in Xenopus and sea urchin. The inverted repeats are essentially randomly positioned with respect to both sequence class and sequence arrangement, so that all three sequence classes are found to be mutually interspersed in a portion of the genome. ?? 1975.},

Here, we show that genome rearrangement events in Thermoproteus tenax created a permuted SRP RNA gene. The 5'- and 3'-termini of this SRP RNA are located close to a functionally important loop present in all known SRP RNAs. RNA-Seq analyses revealed that these termini are ligated together to generate circular SRP RNA molecules that can bind to SRP19 and SRP54. The circularization site is processed by the tRNA splicing endonuclease. This moonlighting activity of the tRNA splicing machinery permits the permutation of the SRP RNA and creates highly stable and functional circular RNA molecules.},

In each case, the function of ARF6-mediated trafficking varies-including localization of specific protein and lipid cargo, regulation of bulk membrane movement, and modulation of intracellular signaling. As described in this review, mis-regulation of endocytic traffic can result in human disease when it compromises the cell's ability to regulate cell movement and invasion, cell division, and lipid homeostasis.},

abstract = {Available data on possible genetic impacts of mammalian retroposons are reviewed. Most important is the growing number of established examples showing the involvement of retroposons in modulation of expression of protein-coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Retroposons contain conserved blocks of nucleotide sequence for binding of some important Pol II transcription factors as well as sequences involved in regulation of stability of mRNA. Moreover, these mobile genes provide short regions of sequence homology for illegitimate recombinations, leading to diverse genome rearrangements during evolution. Therefore, mammalian retroposons representing a significant fraction of noncoding DNA cannot be considered at present as junk DNA but as important genetic symbionts driving the evolution of regulatory networks controlling gene expression.},

abstract = {Spatial genome organization and its effect on transcription remains a fundamental question. We applied an advanced chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) strategy to comprehensively map higher-order chromosome folding and specific chromatin interactions mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with haplotype specificity and nucleotide resolution in different human cell lineages. We find that CTCF/cohesin-mediated interaction anchors serve as structural foci for spatial organization of constitutive genes concordant with CTCF-motif orientation, whereas RNAPII interacts within these structures by selectively drawing cell-type-specific genes toward CTCF foci for coordinated transcription. Furthermore, we show that haplotype variants and allelic interactions have differential effects on chromosome configuration, influencing gene expression, and may provide mechanistic insights into functions associated with disease susceptibility. 3D genome simulation suggests a model of chromatin folding around chromosomal axes, where CTCF is involved in defining the interface between condensed and open compartments for structural regulation. Our 3D genome strategy thus provides unique insights in the topological mechanism of human variations and diseases.},

In order to identify miRNAs and to assess their expression patterns, we sequenced over 250 small RNA libraries from 26 different organ systems and cell types of human and rodents that were enriched in neuronal as well as normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and tissues. We present expression profiles derived from clone count data and provide computational tools for their analysis. Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the differences in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units, and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. {\textcopyright} 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers,.},

@article{Nguyen1996,
abstract = {$\alpha$-Amanitin is a well-known specific inhibitor of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in vitro and in vivo. It is a cyclic octapeptide which binds with high affinity to the largest subunit of RNAPII, RPB1. We have found that in murine fibroblasts exposure to $\alpha$-amanitin triggered degradation of the RPB1 subunit, while other RNAPII subunits, RPB5 and RPB8, remained almost unaffected. Transcriptional inhibition in $\alpha$-amanitin-treated cells was slow and closely followed the disappearance of RPB1. The degradation rate of RPB1 was $\alpha$-amanitin dose dependent and was not a consequence of trans-criptional arrest. $\alpha$-Amanitin-promoted degradation of RPB1 was prevented in cells exposed to actinomycin D, another transcriptional inhibitor. Epitope-tagged recombinant human RPB1 subunits were expressed in mouse fibroblasts. In cells exposed to $\alpha$-amanitin the wild-type recombinant subunit was degraded like the endogenous protein, but a mutated $\alpha$-amanitin-resistant subunit remained unaffected. Hence, $\alpha$-amanitin did not activate a proteolytic system, but instead its binding to mRPB1 likely represented a signal for degradation. Thus, in contrast to other inhibitors, such as actinomycin D or 5,6-dichloro-1-$\beta$-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole, which reversibly act on transcription, inhibition by $\alpha$-amanitin cannot be but an irreversible process because of the destruction of RNAPII.},

abstract = {Plasmid clones containing a human Alu family repeat can be transcribed efficiently by RNA polymerase III in HeLa cell extract. This generated three RNA species, all of which initiated from the first base (+1) of the repeat. By studying the transcriptional properties of deletion clones, subclones, and topologically different DNA templates, we demonstrated that: supercoiled DNA templates are transcribed 3- to 5-fold more efficiently than are linear or nicked circular DNA molecules; a contiguous DNA helix in the transcription complexes that extends into the 5' flanking region of positions -30 to -85 is absolutely required for initiation to occur (this interaction does not involve recognition of specific DNA sequences); and similar to the adenovirus VAI RNA and tRNA genes, the Alu repeat 3' to the alpha 1-globin gene (designated 3'-alpha 1 Alu) contains a split intragenic promoter: an anterior element (positions +4 to +37) and a posterior element (positions +70 to +82). However, the promoter of the Alu repeat functions in distinctive ways in comparison to those of other RNA polymerase III-dependent genes. The posterior promoter element alone is sufficient and necessary for an accurate initiation to occur. The presence of the anterior promoter element, which by itself does not initiate transcription, enhances the transcriptional efficiency by a factor of 10- to 20-fold. Furthermore, the distance between the initiation sites and the posterior promoter element, but not the anterior promoter element, remains constant. These results suggest that the promoter of this Alu family repeat consists of at least two functionally different domains: a "directing element" (the posterior promoter element) that determines the accuracy of initiation and an "enhancing element" (the anterior promoter element) that is mainly responsible for the transcriptional efficiency.},

abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) leads to significant morbidity and mortality; unfortunately, strategies to prevent or treat AKI are lacking. In recent years, several preconditioning protocols have been shown to be effective in inducing organ protection in rodent models. Here, we characterized two of these interventions—caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning—in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced AKI and investigated the underlying mechanisms by acquisition of multi-layered omic data (transcriptome, proteome, N-degradome) and functional parameters in the same animals. Both preconditioning protocols markedly ameliorated cisplatin-induced loss of kidney function, and caloric restriction also induced lipid synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed mRNA-independent proteome alterations affecting the extracellular space, mitochondria, and transporters. Interestingly, our analyses revealed a strong dissociation of protein and RNA expression after cisplatin treatment that showed a strong correlation with the degree of damage. N-degradomic analysis revealed that most posttranscriptional changes were determined by arginine-specific proteolytic processing. This included a characteristic cisplatin-activated complement signature that was prevented by preconditioning. Amyloid and acute-phase proteins within the cortical parenchyma showed a similar response. Extensive analysis of disease-associated molecular patterns suggested that transcription-independent deposition of amyloid P-component serum protein may be a key component in the microenvironmental contribution to kidney damage. This proof-of-principle study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced AKI and the molecular mechanisms underlying organ protection by correlating phenotypic and multi-layered omics data.},

abstract = {DNA error correcting codes over the edit metric consist of embeddable markers for sequencing projects that are tolerant of sequencing errors. When a genetic library has multiple sources for its sequences, use of embedded markers permit tracking of sequence origin. This study compares different methods for synthesizing DNA error correcting codes. A new code-finding technique called the . salmon algorithm is introduced and used to improve the size of best known codes in five difficult cases of the problem, including the most studied case: length six, distance three codes. An updated table of the best known code sizes with 36 improved values, resulting from three different algorithms, is presented. Mathematical background results for the problem from multiple sources are summarized. A discussion of practical details that arise in application, including biological design and decoding, is also given in this study. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The determination of annealing temperature is a critical step in PCR design. This parameter is typically derived from the melting temperature of the PCR primers, so for successful PCR work it is important to determine the melting temperature of primer accurately. We introduced several enhancements in the widely used primer design program Primer3. The improvements include a formula for calculating melting temperature and a salt correction formula. Also, the new version can take into account the effects of divalent cations, which are included in most PCR buffers. Another modification enables using lowercase masked template sequences for primer design.

AVAILABILITY: Features described in this article have been implemented into the development code of Primer3 and will be available in future versions (version 1.1 and newer) of Primer3. Also, a modified version is compiled under the name of mPrimer3 which is distributed independently. The web-based version of mPrimer3 is available at http://bioinfo.ebc.ee/mprimer3/ and the binary code is freely downloadable from the URL http://bioinfo.ebc.ee/download/.},

To make best use of these threads, genomics software must contend with new and subtle computer architecture issues.

Results We implement these methods in new versions of Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and HISAT. We greatly improve thread scaling in many scenarios, including on the recent Intel Xeon Phi architecture. We also highlight how bottlenecks are exacerbated by variable-record-length file formats like FASTQ and suggest changes that enable superior scaling.

abstract = {High-throughput next-generation RNA sequencing has matured into a viable and powerful method for detecting variations in transcript expression and regulation. Proactive quality control is of critical importance as unanticipated biases, artifacts, or errors can potentially drive false associations and lead to flawed results. We have developed the Quality of RNA-Seq Toolset, or QoRTs, a comprehensive, multifunction toolset that assists in quality control and data processing of high-throughput RNA sequencing data. QoRTs generates an unmatched variety of quality control metrics, and can provide cross-comparisons of replicates contrasted by batch, biological sample, or experimental condition, revealing any outliers and/or systematic issues that could drive false associations or otherwise compromise downstream analyses. In addition, QoRTs simultaneously replaces the functionality of numerous other data-processing tools, and can quickly and efficiently generate quality control metrics, coverage counts (for genes, exons, and known/novel splice-junctions), and browser tracks. These functions can all be carried out as part of a single unified data-processing/quality control run, greatly reducing both the complexity and the total runtime of the analysis pipeline. The software, source code, and documentation are available online at

@article{Lucks2011,
abstract = {The widespread natural ability of RNA to sense small molecules and regulate genes has become an important tool for synthetic biology in applications as diverse as environmental sensing and metabolic engineering. Previous work in RNA synthetic biology has engineered RNA mechanisms that independently regulate multiple targets and integrate regulatory signals. However, intracellular regulatory networks built with these systems have required proteins to propagate regulatory signals. In this work, we remove this requirement and expand the RNA synthetic biology toolkit by engineering three unique features of the plasmid pT181 antisense-RNA-mediated transcription attenuation mechanism. First, because the antisense RNA mechanism relies on RNA-RNA interactions, we show how the specificity of the natural system can be engineered to create variants that independently regulate multiple targets in the same cell. Second, because the pT181 mechanism controls transcription, we show how independently acting variants can be configured in tandem to integrate regulatory signals and perform genetic logic. Finally, because both the input and output of the attenuator is RNA, we show how these variants can be configured to directly propagate RNA regulatory signals by constructing an RNA-meditated transcriptional cascade. The combination of these three features within a single RNA-based regulatory mechanism has the potential to simplify the design and construction of genetic networks by directly propagating signals as RNA molecules.},

The acidic polysaccharide fraction from a green alga Coccomyxa gloeobotrydiformi (CmAPS) was isolated and the antiviral action on an in vitro infection of influenza A virus was examined. CmAPS inhibited the growth and yield of all influenza A virus strains tested, such as A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 pandemic strains. The 50{\%} inhibitory concentration of CmAPS on the infection of human influenza A virus strains ranged from 26 to 70 µg/mL and the antiviral activity of CmAPS against influenza A/USSR90/77 (H1N1) was the strongest. The antiviral activity of CmAPS was not due to the cytotoxicity against host cells. The antiviral activity of CmAPS required its presence in the inoculation of virus onto MDCK cells. Pretreatment and post-treatment with CmAPS was ineffective for the antiviral activity. CmAPS inhibited influenza A virus-induced erythrocyte hemagglutination and hemolysis. Taken together, CmAPS was suggested to exhibit the anti-influenza virus activity through preventing the interaction of virus and host cells. The detailed antiviral activity of CmAPS is discussed.},

Indeed, Alu RNAs have been shown to control mRNA processing at several levels, to have complex regulatory functions such as transcriptional repression and modulating alternative splicing and to cause a host of human genetic diseases. Alu RNAs embedded in Pol II transcripts can promote evolution and proteome diversity, which further indicates that these mobile retroelements are in fact genomic gems rather than genomic junks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: De novo retrotransposition of Alu elements has been recognized as a major driver for insertion polymorphisms in human populations. In this study, we exploited Alu-anchored bisulfite PCR libraries to identify evolutionarily recent Alu element insertions, and to investigate their genetic and epigenetic variation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 327 putatively recent Alu insertions were identified, altogether represented by 1,762 sequence reads. Nearly all such de novo retrotransposition events (316/327) were novel. Forty-seven out of forty-nine randomly selected events, corresponding to nineteen genomic loci, were sequence-verified. Alu element insertions remained hemizygous in one or more individuals in sixteen of the nineteen genomic loci. The Alu elements were found to be enriched for young Alu families with characteristic sequence features, such as the presence of a longer poly(A) tail. In addition, we documented the occurrence of a duplication of the AT-rich target site in their immediate flanking sequences, a hallmark of retrotransposition. Furthermore, we found the sequence motif (TT/AAAA) that is recognized by the ORF2P protein encoded by LINE-1 in their 5'-flanking regions, consistent with the fact that Alu retrotransposition is facilitated by LINE-1 elements. While most of these Alu elements were heavily methylated, we identified an Alu localized 1.5 kb downstream of TOMM5 that exhibited a completely unmethylated left arm. Interestingly, we observed differential methylation of its immediate 5' and 3' flanking CpG dinucleotides, in concordance with the unmethylated and methylated statuses of its internal 5' and 3' sequences, respectively. Importantly, TOMM5's CpG island and the 3 Alu repeats and 1 MIR element localized upstream of this newly inserted Alu were also found to be unmethylated. Methylation analyses of two additional genomic loci revealed no methylation differences in CpG dinucleotides flanking the Alu insertion sites in the two homologous chromosomes, irrespective of the presence or absence of the insertion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the combination of methodologies utilized in this study, which included repeat-anchored bisulfite PCR sequencing and the computational analysis pipeline herein reported, will prove invaluable for the generation of genetic and epigenetic variation maps.},

abstract = {Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga whose lineage diverged from land plants over 1 billion years ago. It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced the approximately 120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.},

We present a novel probabilistic method, EMu, to infer the mutational signatures of these processes from a collection of sequenced tumors. EMu naturally incorporates the tumor-specific opportunity for different mutation types according to sequence composition. Applying EMu to breast cancer data, we derive detailed maps of the activity of each process, both genome-wide and within specific local regions of the genome. Our work provides new opportunities to study the mutational processes underlying cancer development. EMu is available at},

abstract = {During the cell cycle, the levels of hundreds of mRNAs change in a periodic manner, but how this is achieved by alterations in the rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation has not been studied systematically. Here, we used metabolic RNA labeling and comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) to derive mRNA synthesis and degradation rates every 5 min during three cell cycle periods of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A novel statistical model identified 479 genes that show periodic changes in mRNA synthesis and generally also periodic changes in their mRNA degradation rates. Peaks of mRNA degradation generally follow peaks of mRNA synthesis, resulting in sharp and high peaks of mRNA levels at defined times during the cell cycle. Whereas the timing of mRNA synthesis is set by upstream DNA motifs and their associated transcription factors (TFs), the synthesis rate of a periodically expressed gene is apparently set by its core promoter.},

abstract = {To monitor eukaryotic mRNA metabolism, we developed comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA). cDTA provides absolute rates of mRNA synthesis and decay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) cells with the use of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) as an internal standard. cDTA uses nonperturbing metabolic labeling that supersedes conventional methods for mRNA turnover analysis. cDTA reveals that Sc and Sp transcripts that encode orthologous proteins have similar synthesis rates, whereas decay rates are fivefold lower in Sp, resulting in similar mRNA concentrations despite the larger Sp cell volume. cDTA of Sc mutants reveals that a eukaryote can buffer mRNA levels. Impairing transcription with a point mutation in RNA polymerase (Pol) II causes decreased mRNA synthesis rates as expected, but also decreased decay rates. Impairing mRNA degradation by deleting deadenylase subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex causes decreased decay rates as expected, but also decreased synthesis rates. Extended kinetic modeling reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation that may be achieved by a factor that inhibits synthesis and enhances degradation.},

The genomic organization of TBX4 was elucidated by computational sequence analysis, and the putative cDNA sequence was assembled. The genomic organization of TBX4 is very similar to that of TBX5, as is the situation for TBX2 and TBX3. The physical configuration of the TBX4-TBX2 cluster on human chromosome 17q21-q22 is similar to that of the TBX5-TBX3 cluster on chromosome 12q23-q24.

abstract = {Basal ganglia are subcortical grey nuclei that play essential roles in controlling voluntary movements, cognition and emotion. While basal ganglia dysfunction is observed in many neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders, congenital malformations are rare. In particular, dysplastic basal ganglia are part of the malformative spectrum of tubulinopathies and X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, but neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by basal ganglia agenesis are not known to date. We ascertained two unrelated children (both female) presenting with spastic tetraparesis, severe generalized dystonia and intellectual impairment, sharing a unique brain malformation characterized by agenesis of putamina and globi pallidi, dysgenesis of the caudate nuclei, olfactory bulbs hypoplasia, and anomaly of the diencephalic-mesencephalic junction with abnormal corticospinal tract course. Whole-exome sequencing identified two novel homozygous variants, c.26C{\textgreater}A; p.(S9*) and c.752A{\textgreater}G; p.(Q251R) in the GSX2 gene, a member of the family of homeobox transcription factors, which are key regulators of embryonic development. GSX2 is highly expressed in neural progenitors of the lateral and median ganglionic eminences, two protrusions of the ventral telencephalon from which the basal ganglia and olfactory tubercles originate, where it promotes neurogenesis while negatively regulating oligodendrogenesis. The truncating variant resulted in complete loss of protein expression, while the missense variant affected a highly conserved residue of the homeobox domain, was consistently predicted as pathogenic by bioinformatic tools, resulted in reduced protein expression and caused impaired structural stability of the homeobox domain and weaker interaction with DNA according to molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, the nuclear localization of the mutant protein in transfected cells was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type protein. Expression studies on both patients' fibroblasts demonstrated reduced expression of GSX2 itself, likely due to altered transcriptional self-regulation, as well as significant expression changes of related genes such as ASCL1 and PAX6. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed a global deregulation in genes implicated in apoptosis and immunity, two broad pathways known to be involved in brain development. This is the first report of the clinical phenotype and molecular basis associated to basal ganglia agenesis in humans.},
