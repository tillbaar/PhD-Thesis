% \chapter*{Introduction}
% An amalgamation of technological advancement and sophisticated magic offers many 
% amenities to the people of Ravnica (amenities that would be extraordinary to
% folk in more common fantasy settings). Almost all residential areas of the city
% enjoy central heating and plumbing, thanks to the work of the Izzet League, as
% well as elevators, and spacious apartments. There also exists an extensive
% public transport system, making every part of the city easily reachable.

% \section*{Section}
% Even poorer neighbourhoods boast clean and smooth roads and sturdy construction.
% No one needs to go hungry in Ravnica, because the Golgari Union provides a bare
% minimum of  sustenance to anyone who can't afford better food, though it is best
% not to think too much about where the thick gruel comes from. The citizens of
% Ravnica enjoy plenty of leisure time, as full-time employment in most cases
% means seven working hours per day, and the city offers an abundance of ways to
% fill it. Ravnica features restaurants with wide-ranging collections of fine
% wines, cafés serving coffee and tea, street vendors offering portable meals, and
% bakeries that sell a wide variety of breads and pastries \citep{Reich2013}.

% Travellers can stay in luxury hotels or simple hostels, or they can rely on
% their personal or guild-related contacts to find housing. \marginnote{This is a
% really long margin note that hopefully extends correctly over multiple lines.}
% Diversions and entertainments abound, including raucous street-side theatre,
% operas and symphonies, illegal fight clubs, sporting events held in vast
% arenas, throwaway popular novels, and great works of literature.

% \subsection*{Subsection}
% These things are shared by the city's diverse peoples, who enjoy a life adorned
% by a variety of  species, gender identities, and sexual orientations.
% Well-established systems undergird society, largely through the efforts of the
% guilds. The Azorius Senate crafts and codifies a comprehensive, though some
% would say oppressive, set of laws, enforced in turn by the Boros Corps. The Cult
% of Rakdos cares for the simple working class and criminal underworld, and the
% Golgari Union ensures that waste is disposed of and recycled. The Izzet League
% maintains the city's infrastructure, and the Orzhov Syndicate provides secure
% vaults and intricate financial arrangements, while their lawyers offer their
% services to anyone who can afford them. The Selesnya Conclave addresses issues
% of education and public health, as well as local public transport, while the
% Simic Combine sees to the biological maintenance and improvement of all
% citizens. \marginnote{This is a note}

% \subsubsection*{Subsubsection}
% Few parts of Ravnica could be considered wilderness. There exist abandoned sites
% where the infrastructure lies in ruins, partially reclaimed by natural forces.
% These are the only truly wild areas of the city, but even those do not last
% forever. It may take a hundred years or more, but sooner or later, these areas
% are reclaimed by civilization. In the meantime tough, they serve as safe havens
% for fugitives, malcontents, and failed, unlicensed experiments in
% thaumatological bioengineering that conveniently eloped from a Simic Combine
% research enclave.

% \section*{Half-Life Estimation}

% Explanation of how we come to model the degradation rate
% $\delta$\marginnote{Usually, degradation rate is denoted by $\lambda$ not
% $\delta$, but the Poisson distribution's parameter is $\lambda$ already.} of Alu
% element transcripts. In our experiment, we measured Alu element expression using
% DTA (dynamic transcriptome analysis) with 4sU labelling. In this protocol, newly
% created transcripts are labelled, making them distinguishable from transcripts
% created before the labelling pulse. In the end, we want to obtain an estimate of
% the half-life $t_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}$ of each individual Alu element, which can be
% calculate from the degradation rate
% $\delta$ by
% \begin{equation*}
% t_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}=\frac{\ln\left(2\right)}{\delta}
% \end{equation*}

% \noindent The labelling pulse's duration $\Delta t$ is 5 min, meaning that 5 min
% passed after the labelling agent was added and before the amount of labelled
% transcripts within the cell was measured.

% With time, new transcripts are created and old transcript are degraded. This
% means that after the labelling pulse, the amount of unlabelled transcripts
% continually decreases, because all transcripts created after the labelling pulse
% are labelled, until only labelled transcripts remain. We assume that transcript
% degradation follows exponential decay, while the total amounts of transcripts
% in a cell remains constant, as transcription and transcript decay are in
% equilibrium. Therefore, the total amount of transcripts remains constant, but
% the ratio of labelled reads increases exponentially.

% \bigbreak
% \noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

% \captionof{figure}[Exponential RNA degradation]{Model illustration of the
% exponential RNA degradation and the resulting $L/T$ ratio over time.}
% \label{fig:expdecay}
% \end{minipage}
% \bigbreak

% \noindent Let $t_{a}$ be the total number of molecules of any Alu element $a$ in
% solution. Among those $t_{a}$ molecules, let $l_{a}$ denote the number of newly
% synthesized (and therefore labelled) molecules. By assumption of steady state
% conditions and an exponential decay, the ratio between labelled and total
% molecules $r_{a}$ for any Alu element $a$ is given by
% \begin{align*}
%   r_{a}     &= \nicefrac{l_{a}}{t_{a}}=1-\exp(-\delta_{g}\Delta t)
% \\ \ln r_{a} &= \ln\left(1-\exp(-\delta_{g}\Delta t)\right)
% \end{align*}

% \noindent where $\delta_{a}$ is the degradation rate of any Alu element $a$. The
% total amount of molecules $t_{a}$ of any Alu element $a$ is also given as:
% \begin{equation*}
% t_{a}=\nicefrac{\mu_{a}}{\delta_{a}}
% \end{equation*}

% \noindent where $\mu_{a}$ is the synthesis rate of any Alu element $a$.

% \noindent\marginnote{This approximation could be replaced by the solution of the
% standard ODE for RNA metabolism, or by a term that takes into account the
% non-constant labelling efficiency for short labelling periods.}Neglecting the
% decay of newly synthesized transcripts, we likewise obtain
% \begin{equation*}
% l_{a}=\mu_{a}\Delta t
% \end{equation*}

% \noindent We further assume that
% \begin{equation*}
% l_{all}=\sum_{a}l_{a}\quad\text{and}\quad t_{all}=\sum_{a}t_{a}
% \end{equation*}

% \noindent We now shift our view from the molecules in solution to read counts
% obtained through sequencing. We prepare a sequencing library with $N_{tot}$
% reads. After 4sU pull-down, we prepare a sequencing library of size $N_{lab}$
% reads. The distribution of total counts $T_{a}$ and labelled counts $L_{a}$
% respectively for any Alu element $a$ is then\marginnote{There is also the
% possibility to choose a (zero-inflated) negative binomial distribution instead.}
% \begin{align*}
%   T_{a} &\sim \operatorname{Pois}
%   (\lambda_{tot}=\frac{t_{a}}{t_{all}}\cdot N_{tot})
% \\ L_{a} &\sim \operatorname{Pois}
%   (\lambda_{lab}=\frac{l_{a}}{l_{all}}\cdot N_{lab})
% \end{align*}

% \noindent We thus assume that the estimated ratio between labelled and total
% molecules $\hat{r}_{a}$ for any Alu element $a$ is given by
% \begin{equation*}
% \hat{r}_{a}=\frac{L_{a}}{T_{a}}\cdot\frac{N_{tot}}{N_{lab}}
% \end{equation*}

% \noindent We still need to estimate $\nicefrac{l_{all}}{t_{all}}$ i.e., the
% fraction of (all) labelled molecules among all molecules in solution. We use
% spike-ins to do so. Let $l_{\text{spk}}$ be the number of labelled spike-in
% molecules, and $t_{\text{spk}}$ the number of total spike-in molecules that were
% added to the solution. We know that
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{l_{spk}}{l_{all}}\approx\frac{L_{spk}}{L_{all}}=\frac{L_{spk}}{N_{lab}}
% \quad\text{and}\quad
% \frac{t_{spk}}{t_{all}}\approx\frac{T_{spk}}{T_{all}}=\frac{T_{spk}}{N_{tot}}
% \label{spk}
% \end{equation}

% \noindent The term $q=\nicefrac{l_{spk}}{t_{spk}}$ is thus known by composition
% of the spike-in reagents.
